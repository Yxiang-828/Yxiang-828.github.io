### Objective

This module serves as an introductory module on information security. It illustrates the fundamentals of how systems fail due to

malicious activities and how they can be protected. The module also places emphasis on the practices of secure programming and

implementation. Topics covered include classical/historical ciphers, introduction to modern ciphers and cryptosystems, ethical,

legal and organisational aspects, classic examples of direct attacks on computer systems such as input validation vulnerability,

examples of other forms of attack such as social engineering/phishing attacks, and the practice of secure programming.

### Outcomes

• Awareness of common and well-known attacks. (e.g. phishing, SQL, XSS, ...)

• Understand basic security requirements. (e.g. C-I-A, security threat model)

• Understand basic defense mechanisms. (e.g. crypto, PKI, access control)

• Awareness of common pitfalls in implementation. (e.g. Secure programming, wrong usage of crypto).

• Develop “adversarial” thinking (i.e. think from the attacker’s perspective)

### Who

• All IT professionals.

• Preparation for in-depth studies in security. (Required for BCOMP Infosec and BCOMP CS Security focus area).

### Security requirements*

*: some called these “goals”, “components” or “properties”.

### 18

## Page 19

How to describe “Security”

• The term “secure”, “privacy”, “trusted” appears in many different contexts and are often abused.

• Secure operation system, Secure cloud, Secure Customers List Management, …

• Privacy-preserving computation, privacy-enhancing technologies,…

• Trusted computing, trust management, trustzone, …

• Military grade encryption, …

• What does it mean? How to describe the security of a system?

• We need more precise definitions and terminologies.

### 19

## Page 20

Security Requirements: C-I-A triad

Broadly, “security” could be classified into these 3 requirements:

### • Confidentiality

Prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information.

### • Integrity

Prevention of unauthorized modification of information or processes.

### • Availability

Prevention of unauthorized withholding of information or resources.

### 20

## Page 21

### 1. Confidentiality

• Edward Snowden leaked classified NSA information. From NSA’s point of

view, this is a breach of confidentiality.

• A student “hacked” into the university system and downloaded the

examination reports. He now know the marks obtained by each student.

Confidentiality of the exam result is compromised.

### 2. Integrity

• A student “hacked” into the university system and modified the grade.

Integrity of the exam result is compromised.

• An application is being modified by an attacker. The integrity of the

application is being compromised. The compromised application carries

out key-logging: it captures the password entered by the user and sends

it to the attackers. As a result, the confidentiality of the user password is

### compromised.

NSA: National Security Agency (USA) 21

## Page 22

### 3. Availability

• Chewing gum sticking to the car door lock.

• A botnet floods a web-server with large number of http requests. A legitimate http

request now takes longer time to be processed. Thus, the quality of the service

significantly degraded. In the extreme case, the web-server crashed and not able

to provide web service. This is a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the

web-server, which compromise availability.

### 22

## Page 23

### Other Requirements

There are many other requirements. Some literatures group them under C-I-A, whereas some argue that they are

fundamentally different requirements. For e.g. many view “Non-repudiation” as a special case of Integrity, while some

view it fundamentally different. Read the context carefully. In this class, we treat “non-repudiation” as ”I”.

### • Confidentiality

### • Anonymity, Privacy

### • Covert Channel

### • Integrity

• Non-Repudiation (digital signature)

### • Authenticity.

• LLM Jailbreak prevention.

### • Deepfake detection.

### • Other(?)

• Accountability (e.g. monitoring and management of system log. Under I ?)

• Traitor-Tracing (e.g. watermarking. Under C?)

• Plausible deniability (Under C or I?)

### • etc

## Page 25

• C-I-A is a broad definition. We might still need a more precise way to describe the

### security requirement.

### • E.g.,

• Consider the fingerprint system that unlocks mobile phone. What type of attack it can prevent.

An attacker who pressing his/her fingerprint on the sensor? An attacker who has the owner’s

fingerprint and can fabricate a physical copy? An attacker who can dissembles the phone and

read the storage? Or an attacker who wants to steal information of the owner fingerprints?

• Consider a secure CRM (customer relation management) solution aims to protect contacts

(information of the customers). The contacts are stored in the cloud which could be pulled by

mobile phones. What does “secure” means, and who are the attackers? Is the attacker a by-

passer who try to extract contacts from lost phone? Or a “man-in-the-middle” between the

phones and the cloud? Or an employee who wants to download all the contacts and illegally

• One rigorous way to describe the security achieved by a system is by describing the class of attacks

that it can prevent. The system is considered secure w.r.t. those class of attacks.

• We can describe a class of attacks by:

• the attacker’s goals

• the attacker’s capabilities (e.g. information and services it has access to)

This description is known as attack model, threat model, adversary model or security model.

• With an attack model, we can compare two systems. If some attacks are successful on system S ,

whereas S can prevent all attacks described by the model, then S is more secure than S w.r.t. the

### attack model.

### Why threat model?

• To protect a system, it is important to first understand the threat model.

### (e.g. many jump

to adopt blockchain without evaluating the security requirement).

• Do not adopt mismatch protection mechanism. Some examples would be studied

### later.

### Trade-off in Security

There is a trade-off of security with ease-of-use, performance and cost.

• (ease-of-use) Security mechanisms interfere with working patterns users

originally familiar with. (aka usability).

• (performance) Security mechanisms consumes more resources and lowers

### performance.

• (cost) Security mechanisms are expensive to develop and manage.

- Difficulty in achieving Security

• (Security not considered) Many systems do not consider security during the early design stage. In

the early stage, typically the main concerns are on usability, cost and performance. This applied to

new systems (e.g. online game, zoom), and existing protocol (e.g. DNS) that was designed much earlier.

• (Difficult to formulate requirements) Difficult to scope the appropriate security requirements.

Designers not aware of many possible attack scenarios

(e.g. many side-channel were discovered recently. Earlier

### .

implementation of crypto didn’t consider the threat)

• (Difficult to Design) System most vulnerable at its weakest point, and there are many constraints.

### (E.g

we understand email spoofing very well. But there is no practical foolproof design.)

• (Implementation Bugs) Even if the design is secure, the system may not be properly implemented,

especially for large, complex systems. Also, it is difficult to verify whether an implementation is

### correct.

• (Difficult to operate/manage) Human in-the-loop. Complexity leads to configuration errors,

mismanagement of patches, credential, etc.

(e.g. developers’ accounts remain in production system)

Known vulnerabilities: CVE and zero-day

• CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a repository containing discovered

vulnerabilities. The repository is public, and thus the whole community is aware of the

vulnerabilities. It is a list of entries—each containing an identification number, a description,

and at least one public reference. Recently well-known: Log4j.

(not to confuse CVE with CWE, a related but different repository on vulnerabilities. A CWE is a form/concept, while a CVE is an actual

instances. A few CVE could belong to a same CWE.)

• Some vulnerabilities are discovered but not yet published. These are called “zero-day”

vulnerabilities. If an attacker deploy attacks on zero-day vulnerabilities, the victims have

### “zero-day” to react.

• Zero-day vulnerabilities are not easy to get.

“Zerodium, a company that buys and sells zero day research, lists $1.5 million as the top price it will pay for a single

submission. The company paid out $600,000 per month for undisclosed vulnerabilities, according to a 2015 interview with

### the CEO.”

Implementation errors among CVE

### E.g.

• Heartbleed* : CVE-2014-0160

• Log4j : CVE-2021-44832

A significant portion of reported vulnerabilities are considered as “implementation bugs”. See report

from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology):

Lack of “Adversarial thinking” during design

One of the learning outcome of this course is to develop “adversarial thinking”,

i.e. always assume that there are attackers who try to compromise the

system and think like them.

Sound straightforward but often overlooked (particularly early computer

### systems).

Consider Pioneer 10 program which is carrying the following plaque into deep

space, with information on Earth’s location and human. Didn’t the rocket

scientists think from the alien’s point of view?

### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_10

Many network protocols, when first designed,

openly broadcast its address and welcome

connections. “hello, my name/address is

1112411. Anyone want to connect?”

(If a mobile device continuously broadcasts this

information, a curious eavesdropper could track its

location by deploying sensors in various places.)

Some other notions: Threat-Vulnerability-Control

Threat: A set of circumstances that has the potential to cause loss or harm.

(e.g. an attacker with control of the workstation in the lecture theatre could maliciously gather sensitive info such as passwords)

Vulnerability: a weakness in the system.

(e.g. anyone can reboot the workstation from USB or Disk to gain control).

Control: A control, countermeasure, security mechanism is a mean to counter threats. (see [PF1.5]

Prevent, Deter, Deflect, Mitigate, Detect, Recover)

(e.g. restrict physical access to the workstation, disable USB booting).

A threat is blocked by control of a vulnerability

Analogy with Medieval Castle.

• We are facing smart adversaries who are actively looking for vulnerabilities.

### • Protection mechanisms

- All round defense: “Security depends on the weakness point.”

### - Layered defense.

### - Access control

- etc (Death trap, obscurity,…)

### More than that:

• Different types of attackers with different goals and capabilities.

• A wide range of security requirements.

### Services:

markets; admin office; etc

### Users:

### citizens; travelers, etc

### Attacker’s goals:

Capture the whole city;

### Steal info;

### Disrupt services;

### Ransom etc.

### Summary & Takeaways

• Need precise formulation of “Security” for analysis.

### • C-I-A requirement.

### • Aware of

• legacy system, don’t-care,

• Designers not aware of the attack scenarios (info attacker can access, attacker’s goal)

### • human error.

• Need to be managed

• Adversarial thinking in analysis (think like the attacker when analyzing a system)
