GEC1015/GEH1049 PUBLIC HEALTH IN ACTION
GUIDELINES FOR GROUP PROJECT – 40% of Grade
Obesity among adults in Singapore

Read the article below, with the hyperlink, which foregrounds the public health concern of obesity
among adults aged 18 to 74 in Singapore:

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/obesity-disease-choice-diet-exercise-medication-
lose-weight-4972646

(Note: You may make reference to the original article in your work but accurate referencing of the
article in the APA style is expected.)

Instructions

In this group project, you are given two tasks:

1. (i) Explain why obesity among adults is a public health concern in Singapore and (ii) using any
two different layers of the Socio-Ecological model (SE model) covered in this course, you are
to explain in detail two separate reasons (one reason for each layer) that contribute to the
increasing prevalence of adult obesity in Singapore (in no more than 1200 words). You may
make use of case studies and examples from elsewhere, but you must show clear and logical
connections to the Singapore context. Making use of real-life examples, evidence, data and
scholarly sources, you should write a short response which demonstrates an understanding
of the two factors you have identified (one reason for each layer) in contributing to adult
obesity in Singapore.

Do indicate your preference on the Canvas discussion forum (in the stipulated forum page for
your group) for the two layers of the SE model your group wish to work with. No two groups
(in an assigned cluster of 4 groups) should be working on the same two layers of the SE model.
The deadline for preference indication is 15th September, 6pm. The earlier you submit your
preference on the forum, the higher the chance that your preference will be accepted. Once
the two layers of SE model are chosen and posted on Canvas discussion forum, no further
changes are allowed after the deadline for preference indication.

Deadline: Week 7, 29 September 2025 (Monday), 6pm

2. Based on the responses posted on the Canvas Discussion page amongst 4 groups (including
yours), provide a short response (no more than 800 words) to evaluate and critically consider
which one of the reasons (stated by your group and others), is the most significant in
contributing to the public health concern of adult obesity in Singapore. You may choose a
reason put up by your group or by other groups in the same group cluster. It is not necessary
to be working on a reason your group has elaborated on in task 1. Do note that you are

required to provide an explanation on why it is more significant than all the other reasons to
contribute to adult obesity in Singapore.

Deadline: Week 13, 14 November 2025 (Friday), 6pm

Assessment Objectives

This group project will assess your ability to:
•
describe public health challenges using real-world examples.
•
Identify and explain trends and patterns related to contemporary public health challenges
•
Apply the Socio-ecological model to explain real-world public health phenomena
•
Work effectively and creatively in teams and communicate ideas clearly and convincingly

Structure of Task 1:

Maximum word limit: 1200 words including the headings given below but excluding in-text citations
and reference list. You do not need to adhere to the stipulated word range for each section stated
below, they are just a suggested guide. However, you are required to indicate the word count at the
end of every section, excluding in-text citations.

a) Introduction (350-400 words)
Your short introduction should describe why adult obesity is a Public Health concern in
Singapore. Provide specific evidence in Singapore to substantiate your explanation.
Thereafter, include a short outline of your two reasons which contribute to the Public Health
concern of adult obesity in Singapore.

b) Explanation of reasons/factors using the Socio-ecological model
(Two separate paragraphs; one reason/factor each – total of between 650-750 words; you
can decide on the length of each paragraph)
Make use of any two layers of the Socio-ecological model to explain the two chosen reasons
that have contributed to the Public Health concern of adult obesity in Singapore (one reason
for each layer). Be sure to integrate evidence and data from academic sources to support your
answer.

c) Conclusion (100-150)
Your conclusion can reiterate the significance of the adult obesity issue in Singapore.

Structure of Task 2:

Maximum word limit: 800 words including the headings given below but excluding in-text citations
and reference list. You do not need to adhere to the stipulated word range for each section stated
below, they are just a suggested guide. However, you are required to indicate the word count at the
end of every section, excluding in-text citations.

a) Introduction (50-80 words)
Your short introduction should outline which one reason is the most significant in contributing
to the public health concern i.e. adult obesity in Singapore.

b) Evaluation (640-700 words)
Explain why the chosen reason is most significant in contributing to adult obesity in Singapore.
In choosing the most significant reason, do also consider the interplay or effects of the socio-
ecological model and describe this in your evaluation. Do note that this body paragraph
should not be a mere reiteration or description of the reason, but rather to compare and
contrast, why one reason is more significant than all other reasons mentioned by your group
and/or other groups. Be sure to integrate evidence and data from academic sources to
support your answer, where necessary. An essay without any reference or citations shall be
penalised.

c) Conclusion (50-80 words)
Your conclusion should summarise the significance of the chosen reason in contributing to
adult obesity in Singapore.

References

All references should be cited using the APA referencing style. You will also need to include a
reference list on a separate page, which is the final page of your report. Failure to cite references
accurately will result in penalization of marks.

Should there be more than one edition of APA referencing style, follow the latest edition.

The instructions on references apply to both task 1 and task 2.

Formatting and Submission

1. For Task 1, please post your response in the Canvas Discussion section as well as submit
another copy of your work, in word document format, into the Turnitin enabled submission
folders for plagiarism check, “Group Project” folder. Assignments submitted into the wrong
folder will not be graded. Failure to post on Canvas Discussion section despite submitting on
the Assignment folder will be subjected to penalization.

For Task 2, please submit your assignment, in word document format, into the Turnitin
enabled submission folders for plagiarism check, “Group Project” folder.

2. You must include submission title ‘Group#’ on all Word documents’ filename. This applies to
both task 1 and task 2.

3. For Task 2, please provide a table (template as below) to summarise reasons listed by each
group in the group cluster. Since there are two reasons listed by each group, each reason

## Page 4

Student copy
Page 4 of 8
should be summarised in separate sentence (one sentence per reason) and the
corresponding layer in the SE model to which the reason rightfully belongs to shall be
indicated clearly in the table accordingly. This table is to be inserted before the essay begins
and it will be excluded from the final word count of 800 words. Reasons listed in point form
or short phrases, instead of proper sentences shall be penalised.

Note that during group project discussion session 2, you are expected to discuss this table
with the facilitator(s). You are thus encouraged to complete this table before turning up for
group project discussion session 2. All group project discussion sessions are mandatory to
attend and attendance will be taken. Refer to the course timetable for the date and time of
all group project discussion sessions.

post, for Task 1 only, should be posted under the same reply threads for the group clusters
you are assigned to. Post your response in essay format instead of posting an attachment of
your submission on Canvas Discussion page. Your response posted on Canvas Discussion
should include your full list of references in addition to the essay.

5. You will be able to submit your assignment multiple times in the submission folder and make
changes. Please note that after 3 resubmissions, the similarity report will be generated only
after 24 hours.

For Task 1, please post your response in the Canvas Discussion section only when you have
finalised the version you wish to submit based on the similarity index generated by Turnitin.
Each group should only provide one response on Canvas Discussion section. Repost will not
be graded. Should there be more than one posts submitted on Canvas Discussion section, the
first post shall be deemed final.

6. Do not include a cover page. Indicate clearly the group number and names of all members in
the header of every page on the word document. This applies to both Task 1 and Task 2.

7. You are allowed to include a maximum of four diagrams (charts, figures, maps, tables etc.) in
your paper, though it is not a requirement to include these. Wherever a diagram is used, it
should be accurately labelled with a caption as well as in-text citations. References for these

## Page 5

Student copy
Page 5 of 8
diagrams are also required in the reference list. Do not include a diagram of the Socio-
Ecological model. No supplementary figures or appendix are allowed. Should you include
diagrams, the figure and table caption are not included in the overall word count allowed for
both Task 1 and Task 2.

8. There are no specific requirements on the font type, font size and paragraph spacing, as long
as it is deemed neat, organized and professional for an academic assignment. This applies to
both Task 1 and Task 2.

Declaration on the use of Generative AI

At the end of your written submission for both Task 1 and Task 2, provide a statement to declare if
you have used AI platform for your writing. Declaration on the use of AI does not lead to any
penalization of your overall score, unless it is used inappropriately without adding value to information
obtained from Generative AI. You are expected to evaluate the information generated, using that as
a reference to build on and create your own discussion to be considered your own work.

If you are not using any Generative AI for your work, you will need to clearly declare with the following
statement: “My group declares that we have not used any Generative AI for the work submitted.”

If you are using Generative AI, proper acknowledgement is essential to avoid plagiarism. Please
account for:
-
the type of AI platform you are using
-
what you are using the AI platform for
-
how you are using it (i.e. what prompts do you key in to generate the results and what do you
do with the results generated thereafter).

Failure to declare the use of AI upon discovered will lead to serious penalty.

Failure to accurately and/or fully declare how AI is being utilised will be a case of academic malpractice
too, upon discovered.
