At the individual level, obesity in Singapore is influenced by biological and behavioral determinants. While genetic and hormonal factors may predispose some adults to greater appetite and lower satiety, these risks are intensified by sedentary routines and dietary behaviors shaped by Singapore’s fast-paced lifestyle, which favors convenient, calorie-dense foods.

How genetics and hormones contribute to obesity:

In general, genetics and hormones contribute to obesity by influencing appetite regulation, metabolism, and fat storage, with factors like leptin resistance and genetic variants predisposing individuals to weight gain (World Health Organization, 2020).

Genetics: Certain genes (e.g., FTO gene) can increase appetite or reduce metabolism, making it easier to gain weight. Heritability studies show obesity runs in families, predisposing some to higher BMI even with similar diets.

Hormones: Hormones like leptin (satiety signal) can become resistant, leading to overeating. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) spikes, and insulin issues from poor diet worsen fat storage. Stress hormones (cortisol) promote abdominal fat.


How sedentary routines and dietary behaviors intensify this effect:

Particularly in Singapore’s context, sedentary routines and dietary behaviors are prevalent in Singapore, significantly intensifying biological predispositions to obesity from genetics and hormones.

In Singapore's urban environment, long work hours and reliance on public transport like the MRT result in sedentary habits, with HPB data indicating that 70% of adults are physically inactive (HPB, 2023). This lifestyle amplifies genetic risks, such as FTO gene variants that increase appetite, and hormonal issues like leptin resistance, leading to overeating and higher BMI (World Health Organization, 2020).

Dietary behaviors further compound this: convenient, calorie-dense foods from hawker centers align with ghrelin spikes and cortisol from stress, worsening fat storage. For example, genetic predispositions common in Asian populations make Singaporeans more susceptible, as familial obesity rates rise with local diets (Ng et al., 2014). Chronic urban stress disrupts hormones, exacerbating these effects (Lim et al., 2016). This interaction drives obesity prevalence from 6.9% in 1992 to over 10% today (MOH, 2020), turning individual vulnerabilities into a public health issue.
