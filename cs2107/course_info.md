## Learning Outcomes

### Awareness & Understanding
- ‚úÖ Common and well-known attacks (phishing, SQL, XSS, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Basic security requirements (C-I-A, security threat model)
- ‚úÖ Basic defense mechanisms (crypto, PKI, access control)
- ‚úÖ Common implementation pitfalls (secure programming, crypto misuse)
- ‚úÖ **Adversarial thinking** (think from attacker's perspective)

### Who Should Take This
- üë®‚Äçüíª All IT professionals
- üìö Preparation for in-depth security studies
- üéì Required for BCOMP InfoSec and BCOMP CS Security focus areas

## Academic Integrity

### Honor System Policy
- **Violations**: Minimum 2-3 grade downward, university notification
- **In-lecture Quiz**: Web access and LLM allowed, no human interaction
- **Assignments**: Discussion encouraged, but sharing "flags" and programs is plagiarism
- **Tools**: Public domain tools allowed (except CS2107-specific tools)
- **Evidence**: Witnesses, access logs monitored
