In this section we introduce the basic terminology of probability the-

ory: experiment, outcomes, sample space, events.

### EFINITION XPERIMENT AMPLE SPACE VENT

A statistical experiment is any procedure that produces data or observa-

### tions.

The sample space, denoted by S, is the set of all possible outcomes of a

statistical experiment. The sample space depends on the problem of

### interest!

A sample point is an outcome (element) in the sample space.

An event is a subset of the sample space.

### 3

## Page 6

### E 1.1

### XAMPLE

Consider the experiment of rolling a die.

(i) If the problem of interest is “the number that shows on the top

### face", then

• Sample space: S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

• Sample point: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6.

• Some possible events are:

– an event where an odd number occurs = {1,3,5};

– an event where a number greater than 4 occurs = {5,6}.

### 4

## Page 7

(ii) If the problem of interest is “whether the number is even or odd",

### then

• Sample space: S = {even, odd}.

• Sample point: “even" or “odd".

• A possible event is:

– an event where an odd number occurs = {odd}.

### EMARK

The sample space is itself an event and is called a sure event.

An event that contains no element is the empty set, denoted by 0/, and is called a

### null event.

### 2 EVENT OPERATIONS & RELATIONSHIPS

Let A and B be two events in the sample space S. We shall go through

some event operations and relationships involving A and B.

### • Event operations:

(i) Union; (ii) Intersection; (iii) Complement.

### • Event relationships:

(i) Contained; (ii) Equivalent; (iii) Mutually exclusive.

### 7

## Page 10

### Union

The union of events A and B, denoted by A∪B, is the event containing

all elements that belong to A or B or both. That is

A∪B = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.

### S

### A A∩B B

### 8

## Page 11

### Intersection

The intersection of events A and B, denoted by A ∩ B or simply AB, is

the event containing elements that belong to both A and B. That is

A∩B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.

### S

### A A∩B B

## Page 12

We can also consider the union and intersection of n events: A ,A ,...,A .

### 1 2 n

### • Union:

i 1 2 n 1 2 n

### i=1

comprises of elements that belong to every A ,...,A .

### 1 n

### 10

## Page 13

### Complement

### ′

The complement of the event A with respect to S, denoted by A , is the

event with elements in S, which are not in A. That is

### ′

A = {x : x ∈ S but x ∈/ A}.

### S

### A A′

### 11

## Page 14

### Mutually Exclusive

Events A and B are said to be mutually exclusive or disjoint, if A∩B =

0/. That is, A and B have no element in common.

### S

### A B

### 12

## Page 15

### Contained and Equivalent

If all elements in A are also elements in B, then we say A is contained

in B, denoted by A ⊂ B, or equivalently B ⊃ A.

### S

### B A

If A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A, then A = B. That is, set A and B are equivalent.

### Then

(ii) A∩B = {1,3}; A∩C = {2}; B∩C = 0/.

(iii) A∪B∪C = S; A∩B∩C = 0/.

### ′ ′

(iv) A = {4,5,6}; B = {2,4,6} = C.

### 14

Note that B and C are mutually exclusive, since B∩C = 0/. On the other

hand, A and B are not mutually exclusive as A∩B = {1,3} ̸= 0/.

### 3 COUNTING METHODS

In many instances, we need to count the number of ways that some

operations can be carried out or that certain situations can happen.

There are two fundamental principles in counting:

### Multiplication principle

### Addition principle

They can be applied to derive some important counting methods:

### permutation and combination.

experiment 1 results in n possible outcomes;

for each outcome above, experiment 2 results in n possible outcomes;

··· ··· ··· ··· ···

for each outcome above, experiment r results in n possible outcomes.

How many possible outcomes are there when a die and a coin are

### thrown together?

### 22

## Page 25

### Solution:

### Note that for

• experiment 1: throwing a die, there are 6 possible outcomes:

### {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

• experiment 2: throwing a coin, with each outcome of experiment

1, there are 2 possible outcomes: {H,T}.

So altogether there are 6×2 = 12 possible outcomes.

In fact, the sample space is given by

S = {(x,y) : x = 1,...,6;y = H or T}.

### XAMPLE RCHARD ROAD

We can take the MRT or bus from home to Orchard road. Suppose

there are three bus routes and two MRT routes. How many ways can

we go from home to Orchard road?

### 25

## Page 28

### Solution:

Consider the trip from home to Orchard road as an experiment. Two

procedures can used to complete the experiment:

Procedure 1: take MRT – 2 ways.

Procedure 2: take bus – 3 ways.

These ways do not overlap. So the total number of ways we can go

from home to Orchard road is 2+3 = 5.

### ERMUTATION

A permutation is a selection and arrangement of r objects out of n. In this case, order

is taken into consideration.

The number of ways to choose and arrange r objects out of n, where r ≤ n, is denoted

### by

### Pn

### , where

### r

### n!

Pn = = n(n−1)(n−2)...(n−(r−1)).

When r = n, Pn = n!.

Essentially, it is the number of ways to arrange n objects in order.

Find the number of possible four-letter code words in which all letters

### are different.

### 29

### Solution:

Note that there are n = 26 alphabets, and r = 4 in our case.

So the number of possible four-letter code words is

### 26

### P = (26)(25)(24)(23) = 358800.

A combination is a selection of r objects out of n, without regard to the order.

### (cid:0) (cid:1)

### r r

(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)

### n n

Note that this formula immediately implies = .

### r n−r

### 31

## Page 34

The derivation is as follows.

(A) Thinking in terms of permutation, the number of ways to choose and

### n

arrange r objects out of n is P .

### r

(B) On the other hand, the same permutation task can be achieved by

conducting the following two experiments sequentially:

### (cid:0) (cid:1)

### n

(1) Select r objects out of n without regard to the order: ways.

### r

### r

(2) For each such combination, permute its r objects: P ways.

### r

### 32

(C) Therefore, by the multiplication rule, the number of ways to choose

### (cid:0) (cid:1)

### n r

and arrange r objects out of n is ×P .

### 4 PROBABILITY

Intuitively, the term probability is understood as the chance or how

likely a certain event may occur.

More specifically, let A be an event in an experiment. We typically

associate a number, called probability, to quantify how likely the event

A occurs. This is denoted as P(A).

### 36

## Page 39

Let us now investigate how we can obtain such a number.

You will discover that the fundamental concept of probability is ex-

tended from an idea based on intuition to a rigorous, abstract, and ad-

vanced mathematical theory. It has also wide applications in various

### scientific disciplines.

### 37

### NTERPRETATION OF ROBABILITY ELATIVE REQUENCY

Suppose that we repeat an experiment E for a total of n times.

Let n be the number of times that the event A occurs.

### A

Then f = n /n is called the relative frequency of the event A in the n repetitions of

### A A

### E.

Clearly, f may not equal to P(A) exactly. However when n grows large, we expect

### A

f to be close to P(A); in the sense that f ≈ P(A). Or mathematically,

### A A

f → P(A), as n → ∞.

### A

### 38

## Page 41

Thus f “mimics" P(A), and has the following properties:

### A

(a) 0 ≤ f ≤ 1.

### A

(b) f = 1 if A occurs in every repetition.

### A

(c) If A and B are mutually exclusive events, f = f + f .

### A∪B A B

### 39

## Page 42

Extending this idea, we can define probability on a sample space

### mathematically.

### 40

## Page 43

### A P

### XIOMS OF ROBABILITY

Probability, denoted by P(·), is a function on the collection of events of the sample

### space S, satisfying:

Axiom 1. For any event A,

### 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1.

Axiom 2. For the sample space,

### P(S) = 1.

Axiom 3. For any two mutually exclusive events A and B, that is, A∩B = 0/,

### P(A∪B) = P(A)+P(B).

### XAMPLE

Let H denote the event of getting a head when a coin is tossed. Find

### P(H), if

(i) the coin is fair;

(ii) the coin is biased and a head is twice as likely to appear as a tail.

### 42

## Page 45

### Solution:

The sample space is S = {H,T}.

(i) “The coin is fair" means that P(H) = P(T).

The events {H} and {T} are mutually exclusive. Thus based on

Axioms 2 and 3, we have

### 1 = P(S) = P({H}∪{T}) = P(H)+P(T) = 2P(H).

This gives P(H) = 1/2.

### 43

## Page 46

(ii) “A head is twice likely to appear as a tail" means P(H) = 2P(T);

### therefore

### 1 = P(S) = P({H}∪{T}) = P(H)+P(T) = 3P(T).

This gives P(T) = 1/3 and P(H) = 2/3.

A box contains 50 bolts and 150 nuts. Half of the bolts and half of the

### nuts are rusted.

If one item is chosen at random, what is the probability that it is rusted

or is a bolt?

### 61

## Page 64

### Solution:

We define the following events

A = {the item is rusted}, B = {the item is a bolt}, S = {all the items}.

Since the item is selected at random, each of the 200 elements in S is

equally likely to be chosen.

• A consists of 25+75 = 100 elements;

• B consists of 50 elements; and

• A∩B consists of 25 elements.

### 62

## Page 65

### These give

### P(A) = 100/200 , P(B) = 50/200 , P(A∩B) = 25/200.

Therefore the required probability is

### 5 CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY

Sometimes we need to compute the probability of some events when

some partial information is available.

Specifically, we might need to compute the probability of an event B,

P(B|A) is read as:

A∩B relative to the probability of A.

In this section, we discuss the important concept of independence,

where learning that the event B occurred gives us no information that

would change our probabilities for another event A occurring.

### EFINITION NDEPENDENCE

Two events A and B are independent if and only if

### P(A∩B) = P(A)P(B).

We denote this by A ⊥ B.

If A and B are not independent, they are said to be dependent, denoted by

### A ̸⊥ B.

### 77

## Page 80

### R

### EMARK

If P(A) ̸= 0, A ⊥ B if and only if P(B|A) = P(B).

This follows from the definition of conditional probability –

### P(A∩B) P(A)P(B)

### A ⊥ B ⇔ P(B|A) = = = P(B).

### P(A) P(A)

Intuitively, this is the same as saying that A and B are independent if the knowledge

of A does not change the probability of B.

Likewise, if P(B) ̸= 0, A ⊥ B if and only if P(A|B) = P(A).

Suppose we roll 2 fair dice.

### (i) Let

A = {the sum of two dice is 6}, B = {the first die equals 4}.

### 6

### Thus

P(A ) = 5/ , P(B) = 6/ = 1/ and P(A ∩B) = 1/ .

As P(A ∩B) ̸= P(A )P(B), we say that A and B are dependent.

### NDEPENDENT VS UTUALLY XCLUSIVE

Independence and mutually exclusivity are totally different concepts:

A,B independent ⇔ P(A∩B) = P(A)P(B)

A,B mutually exclusive ⇔ A∩B = 0/

“Mutually exclusivity" can be illustrated by a Venn diagram (like below), but we

can not do that for “independence".

### 7 THE LAW OF TOTAL PROBABILITY

The definition of conditional probability has far-reaching consequences.

In this section we look at the Law of Total Probability (LOTP), which

relates conditional probability to unconditional probability.

At a nasi lemak stall, the chef and his assistant take turns to fry fish.

The chef burns his fish with probability 0.1, his assistant burns his fish

### with probability 0.23.

If the chef is frying fish 80% of the time, what is the probability that

the fish you order is burnt?

### 86

## Page 89

### Solution:

### Let

B = {the fish is burnt},

C = {the fish is fried by the chef}.

We then need to compute P(B). Using the Law of Total Probability,

### P(B) = P(C)P(B|C)+P(C )P(B|C ) = 0.8×0.1+0.2×0.23.

### 8 BAYES’ THEOREM

We now discuss Bayes’ Theorem (or Bayes’ Rule), which will allow us

to relate P(A|B) to P(B|A) and compute conditional probabilities in a

wide range of problems.

The previous formula is practically meaningful.

For example, consider the events

A = disease status of a person, B = symptom observed.

### Then

• P(A): probability of a disease in general;

• P(B|A): if diseased, probability of observing symptom;

• P(A|B): if symptom observed, probability of diseased.

### XAMPLE

Historically, we observe the collapse of some newly constructed house.

The chance that the design of the house is faulty is 1%. If the design

is faulty, the chance that the house collapses is 75%; otherwise, the

### chance is 0.01%.

We observe that a newly constructed house collapsed, what is the

probability that the design is faulty?

### 93

## Page 96

### Solution:

### Let

B = {The design is faulty}, A = {The house collapses}.

### We then have

P(B) = 0.01, P(A|B) = 0.75, and P(A|B ) = 0.0001.

The question asked for P(B|A). We will compute it using Bayes’ Theo-

### rem.

## Page 97

The denominator can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:

### ′ ′

### P(A) = P(B)P(A|B)+P(B )P(A|B )

= (0.01)(0.75)+(0.99)(0.0001) = 0.007599.

### The numerator is

### P(A|B)P(B) = 0.75(0.01) = 0.0075.

### As a consequence,

### P(A|B)P(B)

### P(B|A) = = 0.9870.
