## 1 P ROBABILITY C ONCEPTS AND D EFINITIONS

In this section we introduce the basic terminology of probability the- ory: experiment, outcomes, sample space, events.

## Page 5

D EFINITION 1 (E XPERIMENT , S AMPLE SPACE , E VENT ) A statistical experiment is any procedure that produces data or observa- tions.

The sample space , denoted by S , is the set of all possible outcomes of a statistical experiment. The sample space depends on the problem of interest!

A sample point is an outcome (element) in the sample space.

An event is a subset of the sample space.

## Page 6

E XAMPLE 1.1 Consider the experiment of rolling a die .

(i) If the problem of interest is “the number that shows on the top face", then
 `• Sample space: S = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 } .`

• Sample point: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6.

### • Some possible events are:
 `– an event where an odd number occurs = { 1 , 3 , 5 } ; – an event where a number greater than 4 occurs = { 5 , 6 } .`

## Page 7

(ii) If the problem of interest is “whether the number is even or odd", then
 `• Sample space: S = { even, odd } .`

• Sample point: “even" or “odd".

### • A possible event is:
 `– an event where an odd number occurs = { odd } .`

## Page 8

R EMARK The sample space is itself an event and is called a sure event .

An event that contains no element is the empty set, denoted by /0 , and is called a null event .

## Page 9

## 2 E VENT O PERATIONS & R ELATIONSHIPS

Let A and B be two events in the sample space S . We shall go through some event operations and relationships involving A and B .

• Event operations: (i) Union; (ii) Intersection; (iii) Complement.

• Event relationships: (i) Contained; (ii) Equivalent; (iii) Mutually exclusive.

## Page 10

### Union
 `The union of events A and B , denoted by A ∪ B , is the event containing all elements that belong to A or B or both. That is`
 `A ∪ B = { x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B } .`

## A B A ∩ B

S

## Page 11

### Intersection
 `The intersection of events A and B , denoted by A ∩ B or simply AB , is the event containing elements that belong to both A and B . That is`
 `A ∩ B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B } .`

## A B A ∩ B

S

## Page 12

**We can also consider the union and intersection of n events: A 1 , A 2 ,..., A n .**

### • Union :

n [
 `i = 1 A i = A 1 ∪ A 2 ... ∪ A n = { x : x ∈ A 1 or x ∈ A 2 or ... or x ∈ A n } ,`

comprises of elements that belong to one or more of A 1 ,..., A n .

### • Intersection :

n \
 `i = 1 A i = A 1 ∩ A 2 ... ∩ A n = { x : x ∈ A 1 and x ∈ A 2 and ... and x ∈ A n } ,`

comprises of elements that belong to every A 1 ,..., A n .

## Page 13

### Complement

The complement of the event A with respect to S , denoted by A ′ , is the event with elements in S , which are not in A . That is
 `A ′ = { x : x ∈ S but x / ∈ A } .`

## A A ′

S

## Page 14

### Mutually Exclusive
 `Events A and B are said to be mutually exclusive or disjoint , if A ∩ B = /0 . That is, A and B have no element in common.`

## A B

S

## Page 15

Contained and Equivalent

If all elements in A are also elements in B , then we say A is contained in B , denoted by A ⊂ B , or equivalently B ⊃ A .

## B A

S
 `If A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A , then A = B . That is, set A and B are equivalent .`

## Page 16

### E XAMPLE 1.2 Consider the sample space and events:
 `S = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 } , A = { 1 , 2 , 3 } , B = { 1 , 3 , 5 } , C = { 2 , 4 , 6 } .`

### Then
 `(i) A ∪ B = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 } ; A ∪ C = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 } ; B ∪ C = S .`
 `(ii) A ∩ B = { 1 , 3 } ; A ∩ C = { 2 } ; B ∩ C = /0 .`
 `(iii) A ∪ B ∪ C = S ; A ∩ B ∩ C = /0 .`
 `(iv) A ′ = { 4 , 5 , 6 } ; B ′ = { 2 , 4 , 6 } = C .`

## Page 17
 `Note that B and C are mutually exclusive, since B ∩ C = /0 . On the other hand, A and B are not mutually exclusive as A ∩ B = { 1 , 3 } ̸ = /0 .`

## Page 18
 `M ORE E VENT O PERATIONS(a) A ∩ A ′ = /0 (b) A ∩ /0 = /0`
 `(c) A ∪ A ′ = S(d) ( A ′ ) ′ = A`
 `(e) A ∪ ( B ∩ C ) = ( A ∪ B ) ∩ ( A ∪ C )`
 `(f) A ∩ ( B ∪ C ) = ( A ∩ B ) ∪ ( A ∩ C )`
 `(g) A ∪ B = A ∪ ( B ∩ A ′ )`
 `(h) A = ( A ∩ B ) ∪ ( A ∩ B ′ )`

## Page 19

D E M ORGAN ’ S L AW For any n events A 1 , A 2 ,..., A n ,
 `(i) ( A 1 ∪ A 2 ∪ ... ∪ A n ) ′ = A ′ 1 ∩ A ′ 2 ∩ ... ∩ A ′ n .`
 `A special case: ( A ∪ B ) ′ = A ′ ∩ B ′ .`
 `(j) ( A 1 ∩ A 2 ∩ ... ∩ A n ) ′ = A ′ 1 ∪ A ′ 2 ∪ ... ∪ A ′ n .`
 `A special case: ( A ∩ B ) ′ = A ′ ∪ B ′ .`

## Page 20

E XAMPLE 1.3 We return to Example 1.2 where
 `S = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 } , A = { 1 , 2 , 3 } , B = { 1 , 3 , 5 } , C = { 2 , 4 , 6 } .`
 `We have A ′ = { 4 , 5 , 6 } , B ′ = { 2 , 4 , 6 } , C ′ = { 1 , 3 , 5 } .`

We check that
 `( A ∪ B ) ′ = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 } ′ = { 4 , 6 } ; A ′ ∩ B ′ = { 4 , 5 , 6 }∩{ 2 , 4 , 6 } = { 4 , 6 } .`
 `This agrees with ( A ∪ B ) ′ = A ′ ∩ B ′ .`

## Page 21

### Also,
 `( A ∩ B ) ′ = { 1 , 3 } ′ = { 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 } ; A ′ ∪ B ′ = { 4 , 5 , 6 }∩{ 2 , 4 , 6 } = { 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 } .`
 `This agrees with ( A ∩ B ) ′ = A ′ ∪ B ′ .`

Similarly, we can check that
 `( A ∪ B ∪ C ) ′ = /0 = A ′ ∩ B ′ ∩ C ′ and ( A ∩ B ∩ C ) ′ = S = A ′ ∪ B ′ ∪ C ′ .`

## Page 22

## 3 C OUNTING M ETHODS

In many instances, we need to count the number of ways that some operations can be carried out or that certain situations can happen.

### There are two fundamental principles in counting:

Multiplication principle

Addition principle

**They can be applied to derive some important counting methods: permutation and combination .**

M ULTIPLICATION P RINCIPLE Suppose that r different experiments are to be performed sequentially. Suppose

experiment 1 results in n 1 possible outcomes;

for each outcome above, experiment 2 results in n 2 possible outcomes;

··· ··· ··· ··· ···

for each outcome above, experiment r results in n r possible outcomes.

Then there are n 1 n 2 ··· n r possible outcomes for the r experiments.

## Page 24

E XAMPLE 1.4 How many possible outcomes are there when a die and a coin are thrown together?

## Page 25

**Solution: Note that for**

• experiment 1: throwing a die, there are 6 possible outcomes: {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

• experiment 2: throwing a coin, with each outcome of experiment 1, there are 2 possible outcomes: { H , T } .
 `So altogether there are 6 × 2 = 12 possible outcomes.`

In fact, the sample space is given by
 `S = { ( x , y ) : x = 1 ,..., 6; y = H or T } .`

## Page 26

A DDITION P RINCIPLE Suppose that an experiment can be performed by k different procedures.

Procedure 1 can be carried out in n 1 ways;

Procedure 2 can be carried out in n 2 ways;

··· ··· ··· ··· ···

Procedure k can be carried out in n k ways.

Suppose that the “ways" under different procedures do not overlap . Then the total number of ways we can perform the experiment is

n 1 + n 2 + ... + n k .

## Page 27

E XAMPLE 1.5 (O RCHARD ROAD ) We can take the MRT or bus from home to Orchard road. Suppose there are three bus routes and two MRT routes. How many ways can we go from home to Orchard road?

## Page 28

Solution: Consider the trip from home to Orchard road as an experiment. Two procedures can used to complete the experiment:

**Procedure 1: take MRT – 2 ways.**

**Procedure 2: take bus – 3 ways.**
 `These ways do not overlap. So the total number of ways we can go from home to Orchard road is 2 + 3 = 5 .`

## Page 29

P ERMUTATION A permutation is a selection and arrangement of r objects out of n . In this case, order is taken into consideration.
 `The number of ways to choose and arrange r objects out of n , where r ≤ n , is denoted by P n r , where`
 `P n r = n ! ( n − r ) ! = n ( n − 1 )( n − 2 ) ... ( n − ( r − 1 )) .`

obj 1 obj 2 obj 3 ··· obj r n ways ( n − 1 ) ways ( n − 2 ) ways ··· ( n − ( r − 1 )) ways

## Page 30
 `R EMARK When r = n , P n n = n ! .`

Essentially, it is the number of ways to arrange n objects in order.

## Page 31

E XAMPLE 1.6 Find the number of possible four-letter code words in which all letters are different.

## Page 32
 `Solution: Note that there are n = 26 alphabets, and r = 4 in our case.`

So the number of possible four-letter code words is
 `P 26 4 = ( 26 )( 25 )( 24 )( 23 ) = 358800 .`

## Page 33

C OMBINATION A combination is a selection of r objects out of n , without regard to the order .

The number of combinations of choosing r objects out of n , denoted by C n r or   n r  , is given by as  n r
 ` = n ! r ! ( n − r ) ! .`
 `Note that this formula immediately implies   n r  =   n n − r  .`

## Page 34

The derivation is as follows.

(A) Thinking in terms of permutation, the number of ways to choose and arrange r objects out of n is P n r .

(B) On the other hand, the same permutation task can be achieved by conducting the following two experiments sequentially:

**(1) Select r objects out of n without regard to the order:   n r  ways.**

**(2) For each such combination, permute its r objects: P r r ways.**

## Page 35

(C) Therefore, by the multiplication rule, the number of ways to choose and arrange r objects out of n is   n r  × P r r .
 `(D) As a consequence,   n r  × P r r = P n r , and so we obtain  n r`
 ` = P n r P r r = n ! / ( n − r ) !`
 `r ! = n ! r ! ( n − r ) ! .`

## Page 36

E XAMPLE 1.7 From 4 women and 3 men, find the number of committees of size 3 that can be formed with 2 women and 1 man.

## Page 37
 `Solution: The number of ways to select 2 women from 4 is   4 2  = 6 .`
 `The number of ways to select 1 man from 3 is   3 1  = 3 .`

By the multiplication rule, the number of committees formed with 2 women and 1 man is  4 2

 ×  3 1
 ` = 6 × 3 = 18 .`

## Page 38

## 4 P ROBABILITY

Intuitively, the term probability is understood as the chance or how likely a certain event may occur.
 `More specifically, let A be an event in an experiment. We typically associate a number, called probability , to quantify how likely the event A occurs. This is denoted as P(A ) .`

## Page 39

Let us now investigate how we can obtain such a number.

You will discover that the fundamental concept of probability is ex- tended from an idea based on intuition to a rigorous, abstract, and ad- vanced mathematical theory. It has also wide applications in various scientific disciplines.

## Page 40

I NTERPRETATION OF P ROBABILITY : R ELATIVE F REQUENCY Suppose that we repeat an experiment E for a total of n times.

Let n A be the number of times that the event A occurs.
 `Then f A = n A / n is called the relative frequency of the event A in the n repetitions of E .`
 `Clearly, f A may not equal to P(A ) exactly. However when n grows large, we expect f A to be close to P(A ) ; in the sense that f A ≈ P(A ) . Or mathematically,`
 `f A → P(A ) , as n → ∞ .`

## Page 41

### Thus f A “mimics" P ( A ) , and has the following properties:
 `(a) 0 ≤ f A ≤ 1 .`
 `(b) f A = 1 if A occurs in every repetition.`
 `(c) If A and B are mutually exclusive events, f A ∪ B = f A + f B .`

## Page 42

Extending this idea, we can define probability on a sample space mathematically.

## Page 43
 `A XIOMS OF P ROBABILITY Probability, denoted by P(· ) , is a function on the collection of events of the sample space S , satisfying:`
 `Axiom 1. For any event A , 0 ≤ P(A ) ≤ 1 .`
 `Axiom 2. For the sample space, P(S ) = 1 .`
 `Axiom 3. For any two mutually exclusive events A and B , that is, A ∩ B = /0 ,`
 `P(A ∪ B ) = P(A )+ P(B ) .`

## Page 44
 `E XAMPLE 1.8 Let H denote the event of getting a head when a coin is tossed. Find P(H ) , if`

(i) the coin is fair;

(ii) the coin is biased and a head is twice as likely to appear as a tail.

## Page 45
 `Solution: The sample space is S = { H , T } .`
 `(i) “The coin is fair" means that P(H ) = P(T ) .`

The events { H } and { T } are mutually exclusive. Thus based on Axioms 2 and 3, we have

### 1 = P ( S ) = P ( { H }∪{ T } ) = P ( H )+ P ( T ) = 2 P ( H ) .
 `This gives P(H ) = 1 / 2 .`

## Page 46
 `(ii) “A head is twice likely to appear as a tail" means P(H ) = 2 P(T ) ; therefore`

### 1 = P ( S ) = P ( { H }∪{ T } ) = P ( H )+ P ( T ) = 3 P ( T ) .
 `This gives P(T ) = 1 / 3 and P(H ) = 2 / 3 .`

## Page 47

Basic Properties of Probability

Using the axioms, we can derive the following propositions.

## Page 48
 `P ROPOSITION 2 The probability of the empty set /0 is P(/0 ) = 0 .`

## Page 49

### Proof Since /0 ∩ /0 = /0 and /0 = /0 ∪ /0 , applying Axiom 3 leads to
 `P(/0 ) = P(/0 ∪ /0 ) = P(/0 )+ P(/0 ) = 2 P(/0 ) .`
 `This implies that P(/0 ) = 0 . ✠`

## Page 50
 `P ROPOSITION 3 If A 1 , A 2 ,..., A n are mutually exclusive events, that is A i ∩ A j = /0 for any i ̸ = j , then`
 `P(A 1 ∪ A 2 ∪···∪ A n ) = P(A 1 )+ P(A 2 )+ ... + P(A n ) .`

## Page 51

### Proof This proposition can be established easily using induction and Axiom 3. ✠

## Page 52

P ROPOSITION 4 For any event A , we have
 `P(A ′ ) = 1 − P(A ) .`

## Page 53
 `Proof Since S = A ∪ A ′ and A ∩ A ′ = /0 , based on Axioms 2 and 3, we have 1 = P(S ) = P(A ∪ A ′ ) = P(A )+ P(A ′ ) .`

The result follows. ✠

## Page 54

P ROPOSITION 5 For any two events A and B ,
 `P(A ) = P(A ∩ B )+ P(A ∩ B ′ ) .`

## Page 55

### Proof Based on the properties
 `A = ( A ∩ B ) ∪ ( A ∩ B ′ ) and ( A ∩ B ) ∩ ( A ∩ B ′ ) = /0 ,`
 `we have P(A ) = P(A ∩ B )+ P(A ∩ B ′ ) .`

✠

## Page 56

P ROPOSITION 6 For any two events A and B ,
 `P(A ∪ B ) = P(A )+ P(B ) − P(A ∩ B ) .`

## Page 57

### Proof Based on the event operations
 `A ∪ B = B ∪ ( A ∩ B ′ ) and B ∩ ( A ∩ B ′ ) = /0 ,`

and Proposition 5 which states
 `P(A ∩ B ′ ) = P(A ) − P(A ∩ B ) ,`

we have
 `P(A ∪ B ) = P(B )+ P(A ∩ B ′ ) = P(B )+ P(A ) − P(A ∩ B ) .`

✠

## Page 58
 `P ROPOSITION 7 If A ⊂ B , then P(A ) ≤ P(B ) .`

## Page 59

### Proof Since A ⊂ B , we have A ∪ B = B . Also, we have
 `A ∪ B = A ∪ ( B ∩ A ′ ) and A ∩ ( B ∩ A ′ ) = /0 .`

Thus we obtain
 `P(B ) = P(A ∪ B ) = P(A ∪ ( B ∩ A ′ )) = P(A )+ P(B ∩ A ′ ) ≥ P(A ) .`

E XAMPLE 1.9 A retail establishment accepts either the American Express or the VISA credit card.

A total of 24% of its customers carry an American Express card, 61% carry a VISA card, and 11% carry both.

What is the probability that a customer carries a credit card that the establishment will accept?

## Page 61
 `Solution: Let A = { the customer carries an American Express Card }`
 `and V = { the customer carries an VISA Card } .`
 `Then P(A ) = 0 . 24 , P(V ) = 0 . 61 , P(A ∩ V ) = 0 . 11 .`
 `The question asked for P(A ∪ V ) , which is given as`
 `P(A ∪ V ) = P(A )+ P(V ) − P(A ∩ V ) = 0 . 24 + 0 . 61 − 0 . 11 = 0 . 74 .`

 `F INITE S AMPLE S PACE WITH E QUALLY L IKELY O UTCOMES Consider a sample space S = { a 1 , a 2 ,..., a k } .`

Assume that all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely to occur, i.e.,
 `P(a 1 ) = P(a 2 ) = ··· = P(a k ) .`

Then for any event A ⊂ S ,
 `P(A ) = number of sample points in A`

number of sample points in S .

E XAMPLE 1.10 A box contains 50 bolts and 150 nuts. Half of the bolts and half of the nuts are rusted.

If one item is chosen at random, what is the probability that it is rusted or is a bolt?

## Page 64

**Solution: We define the following events**
 `A = { the item is rusted } , B = { the item is a bolt } , S = { all the items } .`

Since the item is selected at random, each of the 200 elements in S is equally likely to be chosen.
 `• A consists of 25 + 75 = 100 elements;`

• B consists of 50 elements; and
 `• A ∩ B consists of 25 elements.`

## Page 65

These give
 `P(A ) = 100 / 200 , P(B ) = 50 / 200 , P(A ∩ B ) = 25 / 200 .`

Therefore the required probability is
 `P(A ∪ B ) = P(A )+ P(B ) − P(A ∩ B ) = 5 / 8 .`

## Page 66

## 5 C ONDITIONAL P ROBABILITY

Sometimes we need to compute the probability of some events when some partial information is available.

Specifically, we might need to compute the probability of an event B , given that we have the information “an event A has occurred".
 `Mathematically, we denote P(B | A )`

as the conditional probability of the event B , given that event A has occurred.

## Page 67
 `D EFINITION 8 (C ONDITIONAL P ROBABILITY ) For any two events A and B with P(A ) > 0 , the conditional probability of B given that A has occurred is defined by`
 `P(B | A ) = P(A ∩ B )`

E XAMPLE 1.11 A fair die is rolled twice.

(i) What is the probability that the sum of the 2 rolls is even?

(ii) Given that the first roll is a 5, what is the (conditional) probability that the sum of the 2 rolls is even?

## Page 69

### Solution:

### We define the following events:
 `B = { the sum of the 2 rolls is even } , A = { the first roll is a 5 } .`

## Page 70

(i) The sample space is given by

2nd roll 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 ( 1 , 1 ) ( 1 , 2 ) ( 1 , 3 ) ( 1 , 4 ) ( 1 , 5 ) ( 1 , 6 ) 2 ( 2 , 1 ) ( 2 , 2 ) ( 2 , 3 ) ( 2 , 4 ) ( 2 , 5 ) ( 2 , 6 ) 1st roll 3 ( 3 , 1 ) ( 3 , 2 ) ( 3 , 3 ) ( 3 , 4 ) ( 3 , 5 ) ( 3 , 6 ) 4 ( 4 , 1 ) ( 4 , 2 ) ( 4 , 3 ) ( 4 , 4 ) ( 4 , 5 ) ( 4 , 6 ) 5 ( 5 , 1 ) ( 5 , 2 ) ( 5 , 3 ) ( 5 , 4 ) ( 5 , 5 ) ( 5 , 6 ) 6 ( 6 , 1 ) ( 6 , 2 ) ( 6 , 3 ) ( 6 , 4 ) ( 6 , 5 ) ( 6 , 6 )
 `It is easy to see that P(B ) = 18 / 36 .`

## Page 71

### (ii) Since we know that A has already happened, we can just look at the fifth row:

2nd roll 1 2 3 4 5 6 1st roll 5 ( 5 , 1 ) ( 5 , 2 ) ( 5 , 3 ) ( 5 , 4 ) ( 5 , 5 ) ( 5 , 6 )
 `We are interested to look for instances along this row that gives an even sum. So P(B | A ) = 3 / 6 .`

## Page 72

### Alternatively, we can use the formula:
 `P(B | A ) = P(AB )`

## P ( A ) =

### 3 36

### 6 36 .

## Page 73

### R EMARK (R EDUCED S AMPLE S PACE ) P ( B | A ) is read as:

“the conditional probability that B occurs given that A has occurred."

Since we know that A has occurred, regard A as our new, or reduced sample space .
 `The conditional probability that the event B given A will equal the probability of A ∩ B relative to the probability of A .`

## Page 74

**M ULTIPLICATION R ULE Starting from the definition of conditional probability, and rearranging the terms, we have**
 `P(A ∩ B ) = P(A ) P(B | A ) , if P(A ) ̸ = 0 or P(A ∩ B ) = P(B ) P(A | B ) , if P(B ) ̸ = 0 .`

This is known as the Multiplication Rule .

## Page 75

**I NVERSE P ROBABILITY F ORMULA The multiplication rule together with the definition of the conditional probability gives us:**
 `P(A | B ) = P(A ) P(B | A )`

## P ( B ) .

This is known as the Inverse Probability Formula .

## 6 I NDEPENDENCE

We saw several examples where conditioning on one event changes our beliefs about the probability of another event.

In this section, we discuss the important concept of independence, where learning that the event B occurred gives us no information that would change our probabilities for another event A occurring.

## Page 79

D EFINITION 9 (I NDEPENDENCE ) Two events A and B are independent if and only if
 `P(A ∩ B ) = P(A ) P(B ) .`

We denote this by A ⊥ B .

If A and B are not independent, they are said to be dependent , denoted by A ̸⊥ B .

## Page 80
 `R EMARK If P(A ) ̸ = 0 , A ⊥ B if and only if P(B | A ) = P(B ) .`

**This follows from the definition of conditional probability –**
 `A ⊥ B ⇔ P(B | A ) = P(A ∩ B )`
 `P(A ) = P(A ) P(B )`
 `P(A ) = P(B ) .`

Intuitively, this is the same as saying that A and B are independent if the knowledge of A does not change the probability of B .
 `Likewise, if P(B ) ̸ = 0 , A ⊥ B if and only if P(A | B ) = P(A ) .`

E XAMPLE 1.13 Suppose we roll 2 fair dice.

(i) Let
 `A 6 = { the sum of two dice is 6 } , B = { the first die equals 4 } .`

### Thus
 `P(A 6 ) = 5 / 36 , P(B ) = 6 / 36 = 1 / 6 and P(A 6 ∩ B ) = 1 / 36 .`
 `As P(A 6 ∩ B ) ̸ = P(A 6 ) P(B ) , we say that A 6 and B are dependent .`

## Page 82
 `(ii) Let A 7 = { the sum of two dice is 7 } .`

### Then
 `P(A 7 ∩ B ) = 1 / 36 , P(A 7 ) = 1 / 6 and P(B ) = 1 / 6 .`
 `As P(A 7 ∩ B ) = P(A 7 ) P(B ) , we say that A 7 and B are independent .`

### I NDEPENDENT VS M UTUALLY E XCLUSIVE Independence and mutually exclusivity are totally different concepts:
 `A , B independent ⇔ P(A ∩ B ) = P(A ) P(B ) A , B mutually exclusive ⇔ A ∩ B = /0`

“Mutually exclusivity" can be illustrated by a Venn diagram (like below), but we can not do that for “independence".

E XAMPLE 1.14 (F RYING F ISH ) At a nasi lemak stall, the chef and his assistant take turns to fry fish.

The chef burns his fish with probability 0.1, his assistant burns his fish with probability 0.23.

If the chef is frying fish 80% of the time, what is the probability that the fish you order is burnt?

## Page 89

### Solution: Let
 `B = { the fish is burnt } , C = { the fish is fried by the chef } .`
 `We then need to compute P(B ) . Using the Law of Total Probability,`
 `P(B ) = P(C ) P(B | C )+ P(C ′ ) P(B | C ′ ) = 0 . 8 × 0 . 1 + 0 . 2 × 0 . 23 .`

 `We now discuss Bayes’ Theorem(or Bayes’ Rule), which will allow us to relate P(A | B ) to P(B | A ) and compute conditional probabilities in a wide range of problems.`

**Proof Bayes’ Theorem can be derived based on the definition of con- ditional probability, the Multiplication Rule, and the Law of Total Prob- ability.**

In particular,
 `P(A k | B ) = P(A k ∩ B )`
 `P(B ) = P(A k ) P(B | A k )`
 `∑ n i = 1 P(B ∩ A i )`
 `= P(A k ) P(B | A k ) ∑ n i = 1 P(A i ) P(B | A i ) .`

E XAMPLE 1.15 The previous formula is practically meaningful.

For example, consider the events
 `A = disease status of a person , B = symptom observed .`

### Then
 `• P(A ) : probability of a disease in general;`
 `• P(B | A ) : if diseased, probability of observing symptom;`
 `• P(A | B ) : if symptom observed, probability of diseased.`

E XAMPLE 1.16 Historically, we observe the collapse of some newly constructed house.

The chance that the design of the house is faulty is 1% . If the design is faulty, the chance that the house collapses is 75% ; otherwise, the chance is 0 . 01% .

We observe that a newly constructed house collapsed, what is the probability that the design is faulty?

## Page 96

### Solution:

### Let
 `B = { The design is faulty } , A = { The house collapses } .`

We then have
 `P(B ) = 0 . 01 , P(A | B ) = 0 . 75 , and P(A | B ′ ) = 0 . 0001 .`
 `The question asked for P(B | A ) . We will compute it using Bayes’ Theo- rem.`

## Page 97

### The denominator can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:
 `P(A ) = P(B ) P(A | B )+ P(B ′ ) P(A | B ′ ) = ( 0 . 01 )( 0 . 75 )+( 0 . 99 )( 0 . 0001 ) = 0 . 007599 .`

The numerator is
 `P(A | B ) P(B ) = 0 . 75 ( 0 . 01 ) = 0 . 0075 .`

As a consequence,
 `P(B | A ) = P(A | B ) P(B )`
 `P(A ) = 0 . 9870 .`
