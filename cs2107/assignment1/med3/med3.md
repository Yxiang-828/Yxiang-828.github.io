I heard AES encryption was uncrackable if done correctly, and I'm so confident that I will even give you the encryption code! And even then, I am very confident you still won't be able to crack my secret, haha!

Try to interpret what the encryption code is doing.

Biggest hint is in the title of the challenge - a red herring is something that draws attention away from the matter being dealt with. Recall what type of cipher is AES - what properties does it have?
