This folder contains the exercise and test runner for CS2113 ex_wk1.

Files:
- `Main.java` : Exercise implementation (rename from ex.java if needed)
- `TestRunner.java` : Simple test harness that runs several unit tests
- `run_tests.bat` : Windows batch script that compiles and runs the tests

How to use (Windows):
1. Ensure `javac` and `java` are on PATH (JDK installed)
2. Copy/rename `ex.java` to `Main.java` if the class is `Main` (or edit file name)
3. Open terminal in this folder and run:

    ./run_tests.bat

The batch file will compile `Main.java` and `TestRunner.java`, run the tests, and pause to show results.
