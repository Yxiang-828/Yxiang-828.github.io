PROPERTIES OF THE CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION
Any cumulative distribution function has the following properties.
Right-continuous:
The cumulative distribution function is continuous except possibly for hav-
ing some jumps. Wherever there is a jump, the cumulative distribution func-
tion is continuous from the right. That is, for any a, we have
F(a) = lim
x→a+ F(x).
Convergence to 0 and 1 in the limits:
lim
x→−∞F(x) = 0
and
lim
x→∞F(x) = 1.

EXAMPLE 2.1
Can the following be a valid cumulative distribution function?
F(x) =

0,
x ≤0
0.3,
0 < x < 1
0.7,
1 ≤x < 2
1,
elsewhere
Solution:
F(x) can be drawn as follows:
x

We see that F(x) is not right-continuous at x = 0. So it cannot be a
cumulative distribution function.
