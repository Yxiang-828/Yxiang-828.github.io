# Engineering Design Process Framework

## The 7-Step Iterative Process

### 1. ASK - Identify the Need & Constraints
**Key Questions:**
- What is the problem to solve?
- What do we want to design?
- Who is it for?
- What do we want to accomplish?

### 2. RESEARCH - Investigate the Problem
**Focus Areas:**
- What products or solutions already exist?
- What technologies might be adaptable to the identified need?

### 3. IMAGINE/THINK - Generate Possible Solutions
**Activities:**
- Brainstorm ideas: come up with as many solutions as possible
- Compare the solutions with the needs, constraints and research above

### 4. PLAN - Select a Promising Solution
**Action:** Choose the most viable solution based on your analysis

### 5. CREATE - Build a Prototype
**Goal:** Develop a working model or prototype of your solution

### 6. TEST - Evaluate the Prototype
**Process:** Test and evaluate the prototype against your original requirements

### 7. IMPROVE - Redesign as Needed
**Iteration:** Improve and redesign based on test results, then return to earlier steps if necessary

## Key Features of This Process

- **Iterative:** Steps can be repeated and revisited
- **Cyclical:** The process forms a continuous loop
- **Flexible:** You can move between steps as needed
- **User-Centered:** Always considers who the solution is for
- **Evidence-Based:** Built on research and testing

## Process Flow

The steps connect in a circular pattern:
ASK → RESEARCH → IMAGINE → PLAN → CREATE → TEST → IMPROVE → (back to ASK/RESEARCH/IMAGINE as needed)
