# GEC1015 Public Health: Comprehensive Notes

## 1. Learning Objectives
- Understand the roles of public health in daily life
- Define epidemiological, biological, and socioeconomic factors of diseases
- Explain what public health is and its multidisciplinary approach
- Master screening test metrics: sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV

## 2. Key Terminology & Definitions

### Definitions
**Public Health**: Focuses on the population and prevention rather than the individual and treatment. It aims to improve health outcomes through organized efforts, policies, and interventions that address the broader determinants of health. It deals with the prevention and management of epidemics (IDs and NCDs), health promotion, and addressing social determinants of health.

**Epidemiological Factors**: The distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specific populations. For example, understanding the incidence and prevalence of a disease can help identify high-risk groups and inform targeted interventions.

**Biological Factors**: The genetic, physiological, and pathological aspects of a disease that can influence its transmission and progression. For instance, knowledge about the mode of transmission (e.g., airborne, vector-borne) can guide prevention strategies.

**Socioeconomic Factors**: The social and economic conditions that affect individuals' health, such as income, education, and access to healthcare. These factors can create barriers to effective public health interventions, such as limited access to vaccines or healthcare services in low-income communities. Addressing these barriers through policies and programs is essential for successful public health outcomes.

**Infectious Diseases (IDs)**: Diseases that can be transmitted from one person to another (e.g., flu, HIV, COVID-19). Also known as communicable diseases.

**Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)**: Chronic diseases not transmitted person-to-person (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, cancer).

**Sensitivity**: True positive rate. Formula: Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN). Probability of test positive given infected.

**Specificity**: True negative rate. Formula: Specificity = TN / (TN + FP). Probability of test negative given not infected.

**Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Probability of being infected given a positive test. Formula: PPV = TP / (TP + FP).

**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Probability of not being infected given a negative test. Formula: NPV = TN / (TN + FN).

### Notation
- A: Infected
- B: Test positive
- TP: True Positive (A ∩ B)
- TN: True Negative (A' ∩ B')
- FP: False Positive (A' ∩ B)
- FN: False Negative (A ∩ B')

## Public Health Overview

**What is public health?** = Science and art of creating a healthier environment for all.

**Focus on** population and prevention rather than on patients and treatment.

**Public health issues:**
- Non-communicable disease (NCD): Cannot spread, caused by unhealthy behaviors.
- Example: Diabetes (537 million people, 1 in 10 people), causing 6.7 million deaths in 2021.
- One health: Health of people, animals, and the ecosystem are interdependent.
- Healthcare cost: Increase due to aging population, providers increasing cost, and insurance increasing cost.

## Public Health Framework and Health Systems
### Paradigm Shift
- **At first**: Use of knowledge → change attitude → change behavior to promote healthier living.
- **Now**: Appeal to emotions → change value system and attitude → change behavior.

### Public Health Framework

**Monitor and surveillance**: What is the problem? (who, what, when, where, how) Collect and analyze data to find the problem.

**Identify risk and protective factors**: What is the cause? Is it preventable? Controllable? A priority?.

**Develop and evaluate interventions**: A method, funding, a champion. Interventions can be legislative, community, or individual level.

**Implementation**: Did the solution work? Were the results expected? Adjustments to be made?.

### 3.1 Roles of Public Health in Your Own Lives
Public health plays a crucial role in promoting health and well-being in our communities. It helps to prevent disease, prolong life, and promote health through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities, and individuals.

#### Key Initiatives
- Vaccination programs: Prevent outbreaks and epidemics.
- Health education campaigns: Promote healthy behaviors like smoking cessation.
- Policies: Reduce health disparities by ensuring access to care.

#### Significance
By addressing social determinants of health (e.g., environment, income), public health creates environments that support healthy behaviors and improve overall health outcomes.

### 3.2 Epidemiological, Biological, and Socioeconomic Factors
These factors provide opportunities for public health intervention or present barriers to success.

#### Epidemiological Factors
Distribution and determinants in populations. Opportunities: Identify high-risk groups via incidence/prevalence for targeted interventions. Barriers: Incomplete data hinders planning.

#### Biological Factors
Genetic, physiological, pathological aspects. Opportunities: Understand transmission (airborne, vector-borne) to design prevention (e.g., masks, vector control). Barriers: Mutations requiring updated strategies.

#### Socioeconomic Factors
Social/economic conditions. Opportunities: Policies to address inequities. Barriers: Low income/education limits access to interventions, requiring subsidies or education programs.

### 3.3 What is Public Health?
Public health is a multidisciplinary field involving epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, health policy, and social sciences. It focuses on population-level prevention and management of epidemics (IDs and NCDs), health promotion, and social determinants.

#### Key Difference from Clinical Medicine
- Public Health: Population prevention (e.g., vaccination campaigns).
- Clinical Medicine: Individual treatment (e.g., curing a patient's infection).

#### Scope
- Prevention of epidemics.
- Health promotion through education and policies.
- Addressing determinants like poverty, environment.

primary, secondary, tertiary prevention:
- **Primary Prevention**: Preventing the onset of disease (e.g., vaccinations, health education).
- **Secondary Prevention**: Early detection and treatment of disease (e.g., screening tests).
- **Tertiary Prevention**: Managing disease to prevent complications (e.g., rehabilitation).

diabetes:
damage to small vessels: neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy.
damage to large vessels: blood clots, heart attacks, strokes.

#### Public health frameworks
- Public Health Approach: Surveillance, Risk Factor Identification, Intervention Evaluation, Implementation.
- Socio-ecological Model: Individual, Interpersonal, Community, Societal levels of influence.

What is Public Health? add-on:
Public health is the "science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through organized efforts of society, organisations, public and private communities, and individuals."

## Disease Continuum
- **Pre-clinical disease**: Disease is not clinically evident. Patients feel minor symptoms and signs, thus, they go for screening tests.
- **Clinical disease**: Diagnosed based on clinical findings; symptoms and signs are evident and can be observed or measured. Symptoms get serious.
- **Complications**: Worsen symptoms, signs, and clinical tests.

## Prevention and Screening
### Public Health Coverage
- **Primary prevention**: Prevent onset of disease, keeping the population healthy via health protection and health promotion.
- **Secondary prevention (Screening)**: Early diagnosis and effective interventions to delay onset of clinical disease.
- **Tertiary prevention**: Effective treatment to delay the onset of complications and death. Rehabilitation to improve quality of life. (Note: Tertiary is not covered by public health per the text, but included for completeness.)

### Screening Effectiveness
- **Who should be screened**: When Positive Predictive Value (PPV) starts to increase significantly (e.g., age 50 for colorectal cancer).
- **Does screening make a difference?**
  - **Extends lifespan**: Early detection of illness leads to early intervention, pushing back the clinical disease and complication phases.
  - **No difference**: No serious disease found, or the disease found is slow-moving (e.g., prostate cancer), thus, it will not be life-threatening during lifetime.
  - **Shortens lifespan**: With prostate cancer, unnecessary treatments (like surgery and radiation) can induce serious side effects (e.g., incontinence and sexual dysfunction).

**Public health does NOT cover:**
- Tertiary prevention: Effective treatment to delay the onset of complications and death. Rehabilitation to improve quality of life.

### Screening Test Result
| Disease | Yes | No |
|---------|-----|----|
| Predictive Value | PPV: a/(a+b) | NPV: d/(c+d) |
| Sensitivity: a/(a+c) | Specificity: d/(b+d) | |

Where a=TP, b=FP, c=FN, d=TN.

## Examples of public health in action specifically in Singapore:
- Reduce tobacco use through taxation and public smoking bans.
- Protect People from communicable diseases via vaccination programs and public awareness campaigns.
- Provide healthier food options in schools and workplaces to combat obesity.
- Ensure access to safe drinking water and sanitation to prevent waterborne diseases.
- Provide women with cancer screenings (e.g., breast, cervical) for early detection and treatment.
- Encourage healthy lifestyles through public campaigns promoting exercise and balanced diets to reduce NCDs.
- Promote on-the-job safety regulations to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses.
- Advocate mental health awareness and provide support services to reduce stigma and improve access to care.

What is public health? add-on:
Development of the social machinery which will ensure for every individual in the community a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health.

Public health's approach:
1. Surveillance: Monitor health data to identify trends and outbreaks.
2. Risk Factor Identification: Determine causes and risk factors for diseases.
3. Intervention Evaluation: Assess effectiveness of public health interventions.
4. Implementation: Scale up successful interventions to broader populations.
5. Continuous Monitoring: Ongoing assessment to adapt strategies as needed.

1. Surveillance:
   What is the problem?
   - 5Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why) + How

2. Risk Factor Identification:
   What is the cause?
   - Identify risk factors (Epi, Bio, Socio)
   - preventable or not
   - controllable or not
   - priority

3. Intervention Evaluation:
    How to mitigate or prevent the problem?
    - Identify possible interventions
    - requires: strategy, funding, political will, a champion
    > champion: someone influential to push the agenda

4. Implementation

5. Continuous Monitoring
   > Did it work?
   > After implementation, continue surveillance to monitor effectiveness and adapt strategies as needed.
   > Can you expand or replicate it?

Case study: Leading cause of death in Arizona children 0-4 years old from 1986-1996?

- Monitoring: 5Ws 1H - Drowning in pools, mostly in summer, ages 1-4, all over Arizona, due to lack of supervision and pool fencing.
- Risk factors: lack of pool fencing, lack of adult supervision, lack of swimming skills. Cause: Epidemiological (high incidence in young children), Biological (children's inability to swim), Socioeconomic (lack of pool fencing in low-income areas).
- Intervention: Legislation for pool fencing, public education on supervision and swimming lessons.
PH approach:
1. Seek legislative action
2. develop community awareness
3. develop an individual pool safety program
- encompassing policy, social, and individual levels.
-
- Outcome: Significant reduction in drowning incidents after implementation.

# what is health?
State of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

Internal + external environment
- Internal
    - Genetic
    - Physiological
    - Pathological
- External
  - Physical
  - Social
  - Economic
  - Cultural

These contribute to health

## Social determinants of health
Circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work, and age, as well as the systems put in place to deal with illness.

shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, politics.

examples:
-income
-education
-occupation
-access to healthcare
-housing
-unemployment
-transportation
-ethnicity
-gender
-sexual orientation
-food insecurity

have a significant impact on :
-predisposition of individuals and groups to illness
-the way they experience and recover from illness

**Factors**: Income, housing, education, SES, job security, working condition, transport, access to services, physical environment, race, gender, stress, food insecurity.

**Impacts**: Predisposition to illness, and recovery from illness.

## Socio-ecological model of health
Health is affected by the interaction between the characteristics of the individual, the community, and the environment that includes social, physical and political components.

**Levels (IIICP)**:
- **I (Individual)**: Age, sex, genes, ethnicity, SES, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs.
- **I (Interpersonal)**: Family, peers, friends.
- **I (Institutional)**: Home, school. Access to facilities, goods and services within the institution, living/working conditions, structural factors, institutional regulations/policies.
- **C (Community)**: Neighborhood. Access to facilities, goods and services within a larger social environment, healthcare, community education, safety, sanitation, spaces, sociocultural norms, economic/political influence.
- **P (Policies & Law)**.

**Purpose of SEM**: Understand environmental influence on behavior and modify influences for public health interventions.

Institutional/Organizational:
Access to facilities, goods and services within the institution
Living/working conditions
structural factors (e.g., policies, rules, regulations)
Institutional regulations and policies

Community:
access to facilities, goods and services within the community within a larger social network
Health/social services
community education
safety
sanitation
spaces
sociocultural norms, values, traditions
economic, political influences

Policies:
local, state, national, global
laws and policies that regulate or support healthy actions and practices for disease prevention, early detection, control, and management.

Defining a health system:
WHO(2010):
A health system consists of all organisations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health.

Boundaries: A heatlh system includes teh resources, actors and institutions related to the financing, regulation and provision of health actions.

**Goals of HS (World Health Report 2000)**:
- Better health is unquestionably the primary goal of a health system.
- A second goal of health systems is therefore fairness in financial contribution toward the costs of ill-health. Because health care can be catastrophically costly and the need for it unpredictable, mechanisms for sharing risk and providing financial protection are important.
- A third goal – responsiveness to people’s expectations in regard to non-health matters – reflects the importance of respecting people’s dignity, autonomy and the confidentiality of information.

Restricted, Non-Sensitive
World Health Organization. (2000). The world health report 2000: health systems: improving performance. World Health Organization. 
https://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf?ua=1

**health system vs healthcare system**
- health system: all organisations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health.
- healthcare system: part of the health system that includes organisations, people and actions whose primary intent is to improve health.

## Healthcare system
Primary care:
Intended usual first point of contact for individuals with the health system.
Provide referrals to secondary or tertiary care as needed.
**Coverage: 5,000−50,000 (locality).**

Secondary care:
Secondary care involves more specialised clinical expertise such as hospital care. Physicians are located at hospital-based clinics and serve as consultants for outpatient referrals from GPs(General Practitioners). Also provide care to hospitalised inpatients.
e.g. acute care in emergency departments, planned elective care, usually hospital-based.
**Coverage: 50,000−500,000 (district).**

Tertiary care:
Involves the management of rare disorders.
Such as cardiac surgery, cancer management, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, treatment of severe burns, advanced neonatology services.
**Coverage: 500,000−5,000,000.**

long term care:
Help with everyday activities, such as dressing, bathing, eating.
Provided at home, in the community, in assisted living facilities, or in nursing homes.

## Nutrition
### Malnutrition
**Triple Burden of Malnutrition**:
- Undernutrition (stunted, wasted).
- Micronutrient deficiencies.
- Overweight and obesity due to lack of healthy food.

**BMI Risk Levels (Asian)**: Low risk (18.5−22.9), Moderate risk (23−27.4), High risk (27.5 and above). Higher BMI is linked to a greater risk of diabetes and lower insulin sensitivity. Race affects insulin sensitivity too.

### Poor Diet
- Excess calories.
- Saturated fats (fast food, red meat).
- Poor quality carbohydrates (refined carbohydrates, sweet drinks).
- Lack of fiber, vitamins, and minerals (lack of fruits, vegetables, whole grains).
- Sweet drinks: Hidden source of calories, liquid calories are not filling (people do not reduce food intake), and addictive.
- Inappropriate vegetarian diets: Can lead to deficiencies in protein, omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, and zinc.

### Healthy Eating Guidelines
**Healthy Plate**: Half plate fruits and vegetables, 1/4 wholemeal carbs, 1/4 meat and others.

**Healthy Options (Daily Servings)**: 5−7 servings rice and alternatives, 2 servings fruits and vegetables, 3 servings meat and alternatives, small amounts of fats, oil, sugar, and salt.

**Carbohydrates**: Minimum processed whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and beans maintain blood sugar at a steady state (lower GI) and promote good health. Whole grains provide fiber, B vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. Must have carbs for healthy energy intake.

**Protein**: 3 servings a day, 1 serving from dairy or calcium-rich products. Cooking method matters; no processed meat.

Too much protein: 1) Nutritional deficiencies (fiber), 2) bad breath, headache, constipation, 3) worsen kidney issues for those with kidney disease, 4) heart disease, type 2 diabetes, etc..

**Fruits and Vegetables**: Lesser people are eating fruits and vegetables. They assist in food to energy conversion, act as coenzymes and cofactors to catalyze specific reactions, and are needed for catabolic and anabolic pathways.

# Infectious Diseases
case: cholera
still a problem globally, in 2019 about 1 million cases, 1.9k deaths were notified from 31 countries.

**Types of Infections**
- Emerging: Catastrophic.
- Re-emerging: Known about it, but not spending enough time and resources on it.
- Disease X: Characterized by: 1) Fatality (potential to cause harm), 2) Infectivity (potential to spread), 3) Knowledge (lack of updated scientific and public health understanding to deal with the infection).

**Infectious Disease Epidemiology**
- Identify cause.
- Surveillance.
- Identify source.
- Studies of route of transmission.
- Identify risk factors and interventions.

**Surveillance**
Continuous, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data needed for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.

**Passive surveillance**: Ongoing reporting of a set of known diseases by health facilities in a designated region; lower cost. Risk of overlooking unknown or excluded pathogens or conditions.

**Active surveillance**: Targeted tests, medical records review, healthcare providers interviewed to identify disease. Provides timely, accurate, and complete data. Requires prior knowledge of detection methods or known symptoms; resource intensive.

**Types of Surveillance**:
- Sentinel: Pre-defined list of healthcare providers to provide samples or clinical data over a period of time. Low-level outbreaks: Focus on high-risk groups (e.g., STD testing of sex workers). High-prevalence outbreaks: Focus on both high-risk groups and population settings (e.g., primary care clinics). Hard to estimate the true size of an outbreak since it's only from pre-selected clinics.
- Seroprevalence: Antibody test to estimate the percentage of people in the population who have been infected.
- Syndromic: Monitor and detect potential outbreaks based on symptom patterns; early detection of outbreaks.
- Genomic: Track the emergence of new variants; costly.
- Social media.
- National Notifiable Disease surveillance.

**Genomic Surveillance Gains**: 1) Identification of source and type, 2) improve treatment efficacy by identifying drug-resistant pathogens, 3) minimize further progression to multi-drug resistance, 4) tracking of disease transmission.

**Social Media Surveillance Risks**: 1) High risk of sampling bias by age, language, geography, SES, gender, 2) digital search confounding.

**Bias in surveillance**: Lower-income countries do not have resources to do proper surveillance, thus, lower cases are reported.

**Disease X**: Hypothetical, unknown pathogen causing a serious international epidemic. Could be viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, prion. Could be known or unknown. Could be zoonotic or human-only. Could be vector-borne, foodborne, waterborne, airborne, direct contact. Keyword: uncertain, serious.


#Preventing Obesity, Diabetes, and Cardiovascular Disease through nutrition
contributions of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases to global health and health in Singapore

Obesity: Global Phenomenon
co-morbidities in obese children: low esteem, stigmatization & poor socialisation, health issues, behavioural & emotional difficulties, reduced educational attainment, strong predictor of adult obesity & risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease.

**BMI not a good indicator of health**: Asians have a much lower BMI compared to Whites for the same fat percentage. Asian fat forms around organs, while White fat forms below the skin, forming a belly.

**Obesity trend**: Males and females in the 20−40 age group have a significant prevalence in obesity rate.

**Obesity leads to higher rates of diabetics.**

**Complications of diabetes**: Damage to small and large vessels as sugar attacks inner linings, causing blood clots, vessel damage, and nerve damage. Can also cause stroke and heart attack.

**Causes of obesity**: Epigenetics, genes, energy intake more than output, microbiome, and obesity are all connected.

**Ecological model for obesity**: Equilibrium fat stores = (energy intake − energy output) + physiological adjustments. Biology and environment affect behavior, which in turn affects this equation.

**Social influences on obesity**: Role models (children observe and model adults' behavior, lifestyle, and body dissatisfaction), and peer modeling.

**Physical environment on health**: Accessibility and affordability of healthy food and for physical activities.

**Obesity cycle (Childhood to Adulthood)**:
- Healthy child (no exercise/eat unhealthily) → mildly obese child (low self-esteem) → moderately obese child (subjected to bullying) → severely obese child (health and mental issues) → obese adult (chronic disease and poor mental health).

Triple Burden of malnutrition:
Under-nutrition - being underweight, stunted, wasted, micronutrient deficiencies
Micronutrient deficiencies - iron, vitamin A, iodine
Overweight and obesity - excess body fat that may impair health

Modifiable risk factors for NCDs:
- Unhealthy diet
- Physical inactivity
- Tobacco use
- Harmful use of alcohol

What aspects of diet should be targeted for NCD prevention?
- excess calories
- saturated fats
- poor quality carbohydrates (sugars, refined grains)
- lack of fibre, vitamins, minerals
- high sodium, preserved foods

Minimally processed whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, lean meats provide energy to support body functions, rich in vitamins, minerals, fibre, antioxidants.

rule of thumb: avoid processed foods, eat more whole foods, eat in moderation by controlling portion size, protein rich foods, healthy fats, complex carbs, limit sugar, salt, alcohol.

children show a tendency to tate unfamiliar foods more readily when they ovserve adults eating them. They model themselves on their parent's behaviur, lifestyle and body dissatisfaction.
Peer modelling: children are more likely to try new foods if they see their peers eating them and enjoying them.

place and setting for healthy eating:
home, school, workplace, community settings.
Accessible and affordable healthy food options.
Advertising and marketing regulations.
for effective interventions:
go beyond health sector, 'whole-of-government' and 'whole-of-society' approach.
multi-sectoral collaboration is required to create enabling environments for healthy eating and active living.

key takeaways:
among modifiable causes of disease, diet-related facctors are a major contributor to global ill-health.
Different dietary components work in synergy to prevent NCDs.
Knowledge alone is insufficient to change behaviour, environmental and policy interventions may be among the most effective strategies to promote healthy eating population-wide.

## Public Health Genomics
Public health genomics: Contains 'instructions' to create an organism, encoded in chemicals known as "DNA".

**Genomics Sizes (base pairs)**: Virus (170,000), bacteria (4.6 million), flies (130 million), humans (3.2 billion), canopy plant (150 billion).

**Genomic Epidemiology**: Use genomic data to determine the distribution and determinants of health-related outcomes in a specified population and the application of this information to control health problems.

Genes, DNA, and chromosomes: Genes determine what traits are passed down from mother to father.

**Precision Medicine Goals**: 1) Pre-empt health conditions from happening and act before it's too late, 2) faster diagnosis, 3) optimized treatment, 4) novel treatment (understand conditions to inform development of novel drugs).

**Pharmacogenomics**: Use of genetic and genomic information to tailor pharmaceutical treatment. Example: HLA-B*1502 gene will cause life-threatening side effects of carbamazepine treatment for epilepsy.

**Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) of genomics**: What conditions should be screened for in newborn babies? Public good vs. personal privacy.

**Genetic Tests**:
- Diagnostics genetic tests: Test to confirm a diagnosis based on existing symptoms and signs.
- Predictive genetic tests: Predict a future risk of disease without symptoms or signs.

## Vegetarian Diets
- Lactovegetarian (Lactoveg): Excludes meat, fish, poultry, eggs, but allows dairy products.
- Ovovegetarian (Ovoveg): Excludes meat, fish, poultry, seafood, dairy, but allows eggs.
- Lacto-Ovo-Vegetarian (Lacto-ovoveg): Excludes meat, fish, poultry, but allows dairy and eggs.
- Pescatarian: Excludes meat, poultry, dairy, eggs, but allows fish.
- Pollotarian: Excludes meat, dairy, fish, but allows poultry.
- Vegan: Excludes meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy.
- Flexitarian/Semi-vegetarian: Primarily plant-based, everything else rare or in small quantity.
