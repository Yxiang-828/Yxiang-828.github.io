Introduction

Adult obesity has become an urgent public health concern in Singapore because it contributes significantly to the country’s burden of chronic diseases and healthcare costs (Chay et al.). This is because it significantly increases the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This includes type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and more (World Health Organization, 2025). These are already the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Singapore (Ministry of Health, 2023). According to the 2021/2022 National Population Health Survey, the crude prevalence of obesity among residents aged 18 to 74 rose to 11.6 in 2022. This was an increase from 10.5% in 2019/2020 (Health Promotion Board, 2022) which was double the rate recorded three decades ago and shows the severity of the obesity problem in Singapore (CNA, 2022).

According to the Singapore General Hospital, obesity is the leading cause of diabetes (Phong, 2017), and this currently affects over 600,000 Singaporeans (International Diabetes Federation, n.d.). If the current trend continues, it is anticipated that this number will surpass 1 million by 2050 (Ministry of Health, 2017). This would undoubtedly cause the healthcare system to be under tremendous strain considering the high costs of managing chronic diseases over a patient’s lifetime. This is exacerbated by the fact that Singapore is facing an ageing population, with over 25% of the population expecting to be over the age of 65 by 2030 (Lee, 2023).

Obesity also carries significant economic losses for Singapore due to productivity loss. Obese employees are more likely to take medical leave for issues like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Conditions such as joint pain and fatigue could reduce one’s productivity even when working (NHS, 2023). Additionally, diseases linked to obesity may result in early retirement or disability, which could reduce Singapore’s already small workforce. This is supported by a 2022 study that estimated that excess weight among older Singaporeans contributed to more than SGD 178 million in direct medical costs and an additional SGD 261 million in productivity losses from absenteeism in 2019 alone (Chay et al.).

Given these concerns, it is clear that obesity poses both health and economic challenges at the national level. Our essay will examine the two major factors contributing to adult obesity in Singapore using the socio-ecological model as a framework: the community layer and the interpersonal layer. The community layer highlights how sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy food choices are reinforced by the built environment and work culture, while the interpersonal layer explains how dietary habits are shaped by peer pressure and social norms.

Community Layer

At the community level, Singapore’s built environment and prevailing work culture fosters sedentary lifestyles, with consequences that directly contribute to adult obesity.

Reliance on efficient but passive public transport systems and the widespread use of food delivery applications decreases physical activity while simultaneously making calorie-dense and unhealthy food more accessible. A recent survey indicates that about 70% of Singaporeans expects to use food delivery services weekly, with an average spending of $108 - a 62% increase from 2019 (Deliveroo, n.d). This increase in frequency of ordering in meals also results in a higher intake of sweet drinks and lower consumption of vegetables (Tham et al., 2023). This not only increases consumption of calorie dense foods but also removes the need to walk to the grocery or hawker stalls, further encouraging a sedentary lifestyle. While these conveniences improve our standard of living, it also encourages passive commuting habits and frequent consumption of unhealthy food, both of which increases the risk of obesity.

At the same time, the culture of long working hours exacerbates sedentary behaviour by reducing opportunities for exercise after work. Employment Act (1968) sets a 44-hour work week, full time employees average about 45.4 hours, and more than half report that these long hours negatively impact their work-life balance (Leu et al., 2023). These extended working hours results in higher fatigue levels, acting as a barrier to healthy diets and physical activity (Leu et al., 2023). This concern is particularly pressing in Singapore, which consistently ranks among the top globally for long working hours (Ministry of Manpower, 2023).

Moreover, Singapore’s corporate culture often places greater emphasis on productivity and meeting demanding targets than on promoting work-life balance (Leu et al., 2023). This reinforces sedentary routines, as workers may feel pressured to stay late in the office over prioritising their health. Over time, such patterns heighten the risk of obesity and related conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and stress-related issues, highlighting the need for cultural and structural changes.

Interpersonal Layer

At the interpersonal level, peer influence contributes to growing public health concern of adult obesity in Singapore. Social gatherings often centred around shared dining experiences (Leu et al., 2023) which is made more prevalent by local foodscapes fostering exposure to diverse cuisines. More than 60% of Singaporeans eat out at least once a day (RySense, 2022) and one-third dine out more than seven times a week (HealthHub, n.d.). As adult eating behaviours are shaped by peer modelling (Pachucki & Goodman, 2015), the practice of dining together with colleagues in Singapore, increases the likelihood that working adults conform to group consensus rather than personal preferences, which can normalise frequent indulgence (Leu et al., 2023). Even with healthier options available, taste and convenience rank higher than nutrition (RySense, 2022), reinforcing group norms of frequent, indulgent eating of unhealthy food (Pachucki & Goodman, 2015; Leu et al., 2023).

Beyond face-to-face interactions, the rise of food marketing on social media platforms has amplified peer influence. 88% of Singapore’s population of 5.85 million have social medias with more than 90% of active social media users being aged 18 or over (Howe, 2025). Hawkers and restaurants in Singapore are leveraging on the popularity of social media and becoming content creators where they are deploying humour, behind-the-scenes clips, and short video reels on TikTok and Instagram to attract diners (Khoo, 2025). This has made it significantly easier for peers to share food recommendations or the latest food trends and thus have a degree of influence on their peers’ food choices.

Sevenrooms (2023) found that more than 50% of Singaporeans use restaurant profiles on social media and 43% use influencers on social media to hear about and discover new dining options. While some people intentionally opt for healthier food options, they may end up giving in to visually enticing, less nutritious food trends promoted on social media; especially when friends assure them “it’s just once in a while” (Leu et al., 2022). These factors reinforce unhealthy eating norms and contribute to the rising prevalence of obesity among adult Singaporeans.

Conclusion

In conclusion, adult obesity in Singapore is a serious public health concern with widespread medical, social and economic impacts. As the country is facing an ageing population, the rising prevalence of obesity increases the risks of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer which will undoubtedly strain the healthcare system in the long run. In addition, obesity also reduces workers productivity through absenteeism, fatigue and early retirement which in the long run will be detrimental to Singapore’s economy. We feel that tackling this issue requires collective action at the individual, community and policy levels to safeguard population health and ensure Singapore's resilience.

“What are some reasons for obesity in Singapore”

Obesity in Singapore is the result of a mix of lifestyle, environmental, and cultural factors rather than just individual choices. Here are some key reasons:

1. Dietary Habits
·       High consumption of calorie-dense foods: Popular local dishes (e.g., fried noodles, prata, laksa) are often high in fat, sugar, and salt.

·       Sugary drinks: Bubble tea, soft drinks, and kopi/teh with condensed milk contribute significantly to excess sugar intake.

·       Food abundance: Eating out is cheap and convenient, making it easy to overconsume.

2. Sedentary Lifestyle
·       Work culture: Long working hours leave little time or energy for exercise.

·       Desk-bound jobs: Many Singaporeans are in office-based work that requires prolonged sitting.

·       Technology dependence: Heavy reliance on screens and entertainment at home reduces physical activity.

3. Built Environment
·       Convenient transport: Extensive MRT and bus systems reduce the need for active commuting (walking, cycling).

·       Food delivery apps: Easy access to convenient meals increases consumption of fast food and snacks.

·       Limited time for physical activity: Urban lifestyles discourage outdoor activity, especially given the hot, humid climate.

4. Socio-cultural Factors
·       Social gatherings around food: Eating is central to social life in Singapore, with buffets and late-night suppers being common.

·       Cultural emphasis on productivity: Work often takes precedence over health, rest, and exercise.

·       Family habits: Children often adopt the eating and activity patterns of their parents.

5. Economic & Policy Factors
·       Affordable unhealthy food: Fried snacks, fast food, and sweetened drinks are often cheaper than healthier options.

·       Aggressive food marketing: Junk food advertising appeals strongly to younger audiences.

·       Healthcare costs: While obesity-related illnesses are expensive to treat, prevention through lifestyle change is harder to enforce.

👉 In short, obesity in Singapore is shaped by the interaction of individual choices and broader structural factors—dietary culture, sedentary work and lifestyle, convenience-driven environments, and socio-economic influences.

Would you like me to frame this using the socio-ecological model (individual, interpersonal, community, societal levels), like how public health essays often structure it?

Figure 1. Age & Sex Specific Prevalence of Obesity Among Singapore Residents Aged 18 to 74 Years, 2021-2022 (National Population Health Survey (NPHS) 2022 Report, 2022)


Obesity is a chronic disease plaguing adults all across Singapore. According to the 2022 National Population Health Survey conducted by Singapore’s Ministry of Health, 11.6% of adults in the country are obese, with the highest prevalence among the ages of 40 and 49 (Figure 1). With this percentage being almost double what it was three decades ago, a lack of proper interventions on both individual and higher authoritative levels will only promise higher numbers in the next survey run. With the body being a complex, interconnected system, obesity is not just a one-and-done health concern; rather, it has been found to increase an individual’s risk for other major chronic diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, liver and kidney diseases, and cancer, due to carrying of excess fat within the body. The disease also negatively impacts general quality of life from physical, mental, social, and economic standpoints.

Apart from the individual, however, the rising obesity epidemic has proven detrimental to the larger healthcare system and economy within the nation. With obesity being linked to many other health conditions, healthcare expenses are inevitably driven up to cover the costs of frequent doctor’s visits, medications/treatments, and costly medical procedures. According to a study published by BMJ Open in 2022, $178 million–1.6% of Singapore’s total healthcare expenditure that year–was spent on obesity-related care for individuals between the ages of 40 and 80 alone, with the number increasing to $261 million when economic productivity losses are considered (Junxing et al., 2022).

Obesity, however, is commonly misconceived to be solely the result of personal “laziness”, when, in reality, it is a complex disease that can be driven by a multitude of other factors, including genetics and the social environment. This misconception empowers false stigmas and misdirects efforts to address this public health concern. When it comes to obesity among adults in Singapore, influences from biological and behavioral determinants at the individual level and a lack of regulation on the food market on the larger policy level will be reviewed as contributors to the public health concern in the nation.

b) Explanation of reasons/factors using the Socio-ecological model
(i) Individual Level - Influences from Biological and Behavioral Determinants
 image.png

Figure 2. Mean Offspring Body Mass Indexes (BMI) According to Age- and Cohort-Adjusted Deciles of Father’s, Mother’s, and Midparental BMI Percentile (Chodick et al., 2024)


Obesity among adults in Singapore is significantly influenced by a combination of biological and behavioural determinants. Genetically, some individuals are predisposed to higher body mass due to inherited traits that affect appetite regulation, metabolic rate, and fat storage. For instance, the FTO gene has been associated with increased appetite and lower energy expenditure, making it easier to gain weight. Heritability studies estimate that about 39% of BMI variation is due to genetic factors, with clear correlations observed between parental and offspring BMI (Chodick et al., 2024) (Figure 2).

Hormonal imbalances further contribute to weight gain. Leptin, a hormone that signals fullness, can become less effective in individuals with leptin resistance, leading to overeating (Myers et al., 2010). Similarly, elevated ghrelin levels can heighten hunger, while chronic stress may increase cortisol levels, promoting fat accumulation, especially in the abdominal region. These hormonal disruptions can significantly impair appetite control and energy balance.

In Singapore’s context, these biological vulnerabilities are particularly relevant given the predominantly Asian population. According to Sniderman et al. (2007), South Asians possess a smaller capacity to store fat in superficial subcutaneous tissue, causing excess energy to be redirected to harmful visceral fat even at relatively low BMI levels—a phenomenon termed the “adipose tissue overflow hypothesis.” This suggests that Singaporeans, due to ethnic-specific traits, may face a heightened risk of obesity and related metabolic diseases.

However, these biological and hormonal predispositions do not act in isolation; rather, they are amplified by behavioural factors, particularly sedentary lifestyles. Singapore’s high-pressure work culture, long hours, and reliance on public transport reduce opportunities for physical activity. A study by Leu et al. (2023) found that young Singaporeans often struggle to engage in health-promoting behaviours due to time constraints and societal expectations prioritising productivity over well-being.

Together, these biological and behavioural factors create a self-reinforcing cycle, increasing the likelihood of weight gain and obesity over time. As these patterns are often replicated across generations, they contribute to the persistent and growing obesity burden in Singapore.



(ii) Policy Level - Lack of Regulation on the Food Market (Nutri-grade)

Government policy plays a key role in shaping national health outcomes, particularly through regulation of the food and beverage industry. One such measure in Singapore is the Nutri-Grade labelling system. Per Singapore’s Ministry of Health, “Nutri-Grade” beverages sold in pre-packed form and from automatic beverage dispensers are now subject to new labelling requirements. Nutri-grade is a labelling system that grades products based on their sugar and saturated fat content, and this policy has helped raise awareness for the public when selecting their beverage. According to Singapore’s Ministry of Health reports, the median sugar level of pre-packed Nutri-Grade beverages has reduced from 7.1% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2023, and beverages graded ’A’ or ’B’ purchased increased from 37% to 69%. This implemented measure has helped consumers identify healthier options, which has, in turn, led to reduced total sugar intake.

However, despite its merits, Nutri-Grade remains limited as it currently applies only to beverages. According to the 2022 National Nutrition Survey, the largest contributors to unhealthy diets are not drinks alone, but also sodium-heavy sauces, seasonings, and instant noodles, accounting for three-quarters of daily sodium intake, and cooking oil, contributing to one-third of saturated fat intake (Lim, 2024). Without extending regulation to these food categories, Singapore’s efforts to address obesity are only partially successful. While Singapore is among the more proactive Southeast Asian countries in tackling obesity, its policies need to be broadened and strengthened to regulate everyday food items that heavily influence adult diets. Expanding Nutri-Grade to food culprits would provide more comprehensive nutritional transparency, empowering Singaporeans to make informed dietary decisions and reducing the structural barriers to healthier living (MOH, 2025).

Furthermore, the Nutri-Grade system is incomprehensive as it does not account for other nutrients, such as vitamins and sodium, nor hidden artificial sweeteners. For instance, a diet soda might get a grade of ‘A’ or ‘B’ due to zero sugar content, but it may contain artificial sweeteners and have no nutritional value. Consumers are thus misled into assuming that a drink with a grade ‘A’ or ‘B’ is “healthy”, despite it being ultra-processed or low in nutritional value.

Obesity in Singapore is a multifaceted public health issue shaped by both individual and policy-level factors. At the individual level, biological predispositions, such as genetics and hormonal influences, interact with behavioural habits like sedentary routines and unhealthy diets, creating conditions that predispose adults to obesity. At the policy level, interventions like the Nutri-Grade labelling system have shown encouraging progress in shifting beverage consumption patterns, yet limitations remain when broader food categories remain unregulated (Lui, 2025). Ultimately, reducing obesity requires an integrated approach acknowledging individual biological risks, while also reshaping larger food environments through comprehensive, enforceable policies. Given the escalating healthcare costs and long-term social implications of obesity, Singapore must move decisively to expand its regulations, promote healthier diets, and foster supportive environments that make healthy living the default choice for its citizens.

Introduction
Obesity is a condition that affects appetite regulation, energy storage, and metabolism. It involves hormonal imbalances, making it harder to maintain a healthy weight. When excess energy is stored as fat cells, it can lead to an increased risk of chronic noncommunicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (World Health Organisation, 2025). In Singapore, obesity is becoming increasingly concerning as nearly 12 out of every 100 adults aged 18-74 were classified as obese, double the rate from 30 years ago. This increases the risk of chronic diseases in the population, which can place a strain on the healthcare system. High BMI contributes to 12% of the disease burden nationally and can even lead to lost productivity, costing the economy through co-morbidities (CNA, 2025; Health Promotion Board, 2016). To tackle this, multifactorial causes must be identified to create effective public health solutions that address them. Using the socio-ecological model, key reasons contributing to the increase in adult obesity in Singapore were identified under the Individual layer: a complacent attitude towards obesity, and under the Institutional layer: an ingrained sedentary culture in white-collar workplaces. [176 words]

Explanation of reasons using the Socio-ecological model
2.1 Individual Level: Complacent Attitudes Increase Propensity for Obesity

A considerable amount of an individual’s risk for this disease is determined by their choices and attitudes towards maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Complacency, defined as behavioural inaction due to low perceived need, increases obesity risk as this attitude implies less worry about how actions influence future health due to the belief obesity isn’t a major risk for them. For such individuals, choices may be shaped by less regulation of food choice or exercise. This is compared to someone who adopts a proactive lifestyle, planning around long-term health goals and engaging in preventative health screenings. The differences in attitudes between the two predispose a complacent individual to obesity.

Although genetic and structural factors are also important, twin studies show that after eliminating genetic context, higher BMIs are significantly associated with high caloric intake and low activity (Doornweerd et al., 2016). This is relevant in Singapore, as despite large-scale public health campaigns including War on Diabetes and Healthier SG, obesity prevalence has risen (Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Board, 2022), highlighting how structural interventions are ineffective unless personal beliefs are addressed as these shape motivation and perceived susceptibility.

3 key reasons for complacent attitudes have been identified. First, Singapore has one of the best healthcare systems in the world with 83.8% of respondents believing that the national healthcare is good (Joshi et al., 2009). Behavioural economics studies have shown that a high trust in the healthcare system can undermine preventative urgency due to the ‘ex ante moral hazard’ phenomenon where care available is believed to be enough to manage any condition (Dave & Kaestner, 2009). However, in obesity this is difficult excess fat primes the body to be prone to future weight gain (Hinte et al., 2024) Therefore, changing attitudes towards lifestyle changes rather than reliance on treatments is crucial to reduce obesity.

This is linked to the next reason whereby work is prioritised over health supported by the belief effective healthcare is available. Though pressure to work is multifactorial, including values of filial piety our discussion aims to analyse how prioritisation reinforces complacency. The intense value placed on career is seen by Singapore’s work hours being the highest among OECDs at 45.6 hours on average and low work-life balance (Ministry of Manpower, 2025). Surveys of working adults in Singapore demonstrate how this can sway lifestyle choices negatively as despite participants knowing the importance of healthy habits, feeling pressured to prioritise workplace success, thus allowing their diet choices to be skewed and neglecting fitness (Leu et al., 2023). This directly contributes to increased risks of obesity amongst the adult population.

Lastly, there is a consistent misperception of individual health whereby one thinks they are healthier or less at risk than reality. A study in Singapore found that more than a third of obese or overweight participants wrongly placed themselves in the healthy weight category (Kim et. al, 2022), which is dangerous as the threshold for obesity in Asians is lower. Thus, misperception fosters complacency as individuals underestimate their risk and delay preventive lifestyle measures. [493 words]

2.2 Institutional Level: Ingrained Sedentary Culture at White-Collar Workplaces

When examining the “Institutional” layer of the socio-ecological model, it is observed that a predominant sedentary culture deeply embedded within the structural aspects of white-collar workplaces leads to the rising prevalence of adult obesity in Singapore.

Workplace sedentary culture is defined as a set of organisational practices, values and perceptions that indirectly or directly encourages physical inactivity, which is a factor contributing to obesity, due to prolonged sitting during working hours (Taylor et al., 2018). This phenomenon is prevalent in office environments due to the inherent attributes such as the nature of work and organisational social expectations (e.g., being at one’s desk without taking any mobility breaks translates to being productive) which act as barriers in minimising sedentary behaviour.

When exploring what leads to the sedentary culture at offices, long working hours combined with high workload seemed to have exacerbated the issue on prolonged sitting. According to a case study involving white-collar workers in Singapore, an average of 8.7–9.0 hours were spent daily at workplaces which constitutes a significant portion of their waking hours and when queried regarding time pressure, nearly 40% of the respondents mentioned that they were almost always or often pressed for time at work due to excessive workload (Leu et al., 2023). This is further supported by another study that reveals 57.5% of participants only consumed 0–1 breaks per hour (Waters et al., 2016). Thus, it is evident that long working hours coupled with high workload might lead to very limited active breaks taken which act as a barrier in reducing both prolonged sitting and time outside for exercise.

Additionally, limited flexibility surrounding white-collar office arrangements can contribute to obesity risk. Japan’s work culture shares similarities with Singapore’s, especially regarding inflexible work culture being the norm. This contributes to workplace sedentary culture (Ono, 2022; Wang & Cheng, 2025). A study found that Japanese employees who work from home gain 0.3 BMI units less than those working from office (Nakatsuka et al., 2024). This is attributable to the significant portion of time saved through commuting, which can be freed up for short breaks to stretch or walk, promoting active movement to burn calories. The extra time may also enable meal preparation with healthier options.  The similarities of both countries allows us to learn how in Singapore, where 64.4% report that their physical wellbeing improved when working remotely (Cisco, n.d.), rigid work arrangements may be fostering higher obesity rates.

Further, while 70% of multinational corporations in Singapore provide health programmes for employees, citing a lack of physical activity as a major health issue of concern, 91% of these companies do not tailor the programmes to the specific needs of their employees. (The Straits Times, 2016). Thus, health advice given may be impractical for desk bound workers to implement. Furthermore, 94% of companies do not evaluate their programmes on an ongoing basis for their effectiveness and intended health outcomes like reduced sitting time. These gaps could continue to perpetuate a sedentary work culture leading to higher rates of obesity. [486 words]

Conclusion
We believe addressing these factors is of utmost significance as failing to address rising adult obesity and its associated morbidities could place the national healthcare system under immense strain, costing billions of dollars and skewing citizens’ quality of life. [41 words]

Introduction


For decades, obesity has persisted as a critical global health issue. (Global Nutrition Report, 2018). As one of the major drivers for type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases (Unicef, 2017), it not only reduces the quality of life but also places a burden on healthcare systems, making it a significant public health concern worldwide. Singapore is no exception. Diabetes here is heavily influenced by lifestyle factors, with obesity contributing to a whopping 50% of its disease burden (Ministry of Health, 2021).  Alarmingly, one in three people locally is projected to develop diabetes in their lifetime, and if current trends persist, the number of cases could reach one million by 2050. This underscores the fact that obesity has a leading role to play in the cause of non-communicable diseases (Ministry of Health, 2021). Furthermore, beyond health outcomes, obesity also adds to the nation’s healthcare costs, with obesity-related expenditures estimated at around S$261 million annually (Duke-NUS, 2019). Despite Singapore’s advanced healthcare system and emphasis on healthy living, the profusion of adult obesity has been on the rise. From 11.6% in 2022 to 8.6% in 2017 (MOH, 2022), the data reflect a worrying upward trend that threatens both national public health and economic sustainability.  The escalation in obesity rates has been attributed to individual and community factors. Individually, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs often foster poor dietary habits. With many adults prioritising taste, convenience, or cost over nutrition, it reinforces unhealthy eating patterns, leading to obesity. Additionally, at the community level, Singapore’s work-centric culture further exacerbates the issue. The long working hours and high stress make convenience prized and sedentariness normalised, fuelling sedentary lifestyles and a driving reliance on calorie-dense, quick food options. Together, these factors interact to sustain and worsen obesity trends among adults in Singapore.

Explanation for individual layer


At the individual layer of the Socio-Ecological model, obesity in Singapore is shaped by preferences and beliefs that favour convenience and comfort over long-term health. A recent report noted that about 11% of adult Singaporeans replaced full meals with snacks in 2024, up from 8% in 2023, as individuals choose to prioritise short-term convenience and satisfaction over health, to cope with the demands of work and daily life (Singapore Business Review, 2025). This decision to replace balanced meals with snacks is not the result of ignorance, but rather an intentional trade-off that reflects individual values. Likewise, many Singaporeans hold the belief that occasional indulgence is harmless, regularly consuming high-calorie food items like bubble tea and fast foods,  foods strongly associated with comfort and enjoyment (Dang, H. L., 2025). Additionally, personal beliefs also play a role in causing obesity. Studies in Singapore show that attitudes regarding self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control significantly

influence eating behaviours, with Singaporeans believing that they can offset their unhealthy lifestyle choices through exercise or other compensatory actions (Letícia, 2019). This attitude of perceived control, combined with the earlier-mentioned preference for convenience over health, demonstrates how obesity is a result of individual-level values and decisions. On the other hand, knowledge gaps and misconceptions are also to blame for obesity. While some Singaporeans knowingly opt for unhealthy foods over balanced meals for convenience, others are simply not aware of how unhealthy their food choices are. Many underestimate the calories or sugar content of the food they consume, hence misjudging their daily energy intake. For example, bubble tea can contain 300-500 kcal per serving, but is still treated as a minor indulgence. Furthermore, many are unable to gauge portion sizes and interpret food labels accurately. This lack of nutritional literacy leaves Singaporeans susceptible to being tricked by “health halo” foods - thinking that all fruit juices or low-fat snacks are healthy, even though some are high in sugar content. Caloric underestimation due to insufficient knowledge is a real problem - the National Nutrition Survey 2022 found that 61% of Singaporeans exceeded their recommended daily calorie intake, up from 55% in 2019 (Health Promotion Board, 2022). Singaporeans simply don’t know what is good for themselves, and are becoming obese because of it. Hence, considering personal preferences and beliefs, as well as the knowledge gaps and misconceptions among Singaporeans, it is evident that effective interventions must also target motivational and psychological drivers at the individual level.

Explanation for community layer
At the community layer of the Socio-Ecological Model, a significant factor contributing to the increasing prevalence of adult obesity in Singapore is its pervasive work-centric culture. This culture manifests as a collective societal norm where long working hours and a sustained focus on productivity are prioritised, often at the expense of personal health and well-being. This community-level influence systematically fosters an environment conducive to unhealthy lifestyles. A primary outcome of this culture is the promotion of sedentary routines. With Singaporeans working some of the longest hours globally, the average weekly hours worked was 44.1 in 2023 (Ministry of Manpower, 2024). This situation is compounded by a long commute and the prevalence of desk-bound occupations, which minimise incidental physical movement throughout the workday. Consequently, a sedentary lifestyle becomes the default for the majority of the working population, normalising inactivity as an accepted feature of daily life. Furthermore, this intense work culture normalises a reliance on convenience-based diets. Due to significant time pressures, working adults increasingly depend on readily available meals from hawker centres and an expanding network of food delivery services. Research on young Singaporean adults has shown that long working hours and the associated stress lead to a preference for convenient, cheap, and often calorie-dense food, especially during overtime (Teo et al., 2023). The accessibility to these food sources makes them the path of least resistance in a time-poor society. This dietary pattern also permeates social life, where community and peer bonding activities often centre around energy-dense meals, reinforcing the association between

social interaction and high-calorie food. Underpinning these behavioural patterns is a broader community value system that implicitly prioritises economic and academic achievement over physical health. This "wealth over health" idea is evident across different life stages. For students, the educational framework is primarily structured to develop skills for a competitive workforce, with less institutional emphasis on cultivating lifelong habits for physical well-being. For working adults, career advancement is their central focus, where unhealthy food may serve as a mechanism for stress relief or a time-saving measure, while regular exercise is often deprioritised. For the elderly, this demographic frequently confronts the cumulative negative health consequences of a lifetime dedicated to work, illustrating the long-term societal impact of this norm. Hence, a pervasive work-centric culture, increased reliance on calorie-dense food, and the "wealth over health" idea normalise the sacrifice of health for career advancement, contributing significantly to the rise of obesity.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a multitude of factors jointly exacerbate the issue of adult obesity in Singapore. From the culture fixated on work to individuals' beliefs, attitudes and preferences, obesity continues to be a pertinent problem plaguing Singapore’s public health system. Though existing measures are put in place to alleviate the issue, it is clearly insufficient, as highlighted by the rising prevalence of adult obesity rates. Only by addressing adult obesity through targeted, intentional and sustainable strategies can the problem be truly tackled. (Ministry of Health, 2023) Until such solutions are implemented comprehensively, adult obesity will continue to endanger the enduring sustainability of our healthcare system and diminish the overall health of the population. Tackling this issue is therefore not only a matter of individual health, but also a vital public health priority for Singapore's long-term social and economic sustainability.
