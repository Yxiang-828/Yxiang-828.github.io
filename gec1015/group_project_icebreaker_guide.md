# GEC1015/GEH1049 Group Project – Icebreaker Task Guide


Welcome! This guide breaks down the project instructions into clear stages for both tasks. Use it as a checklist and reference for your group’s icebreaker discussion. Hints are provided to help you brainstorm and research effectively.

## Distinguishing Public Health vs. Medical Care

When discussing obesity or using article evidence, remember:

- **Public Health** focuses on preventing disease, promoting health, and protecting populations through organized efforts (e.g., policy, education, environmental changes, community programs).
- **Medical Care** focuses on diagnosing and treating illness in individuals (e.g., prescribing medication, surgery, clinical care).

**In your project:**
- Highlight how public health approaches (like policy changes, education, and community interventions) address obesity at the population level.
- Use medical care examples (like new drugs or clinical treatment) to show individual-level solutions, but emphasize that public health strategies are needed for broad, sustainable impact.

**Hint:** When analyzing articles or evidence, note how both medical advances and public health solutions are discussed, and be clear about which is which in your arguments.

## Task 1: Explaining Adult Obesity as a Public Health Concern

### 1. Understand the Public Health Issue
- Research why adult obesity is a significant concern in Singapore.
- Gather local statistics, trends, and health impacts.
- **Hint:** Look for recent data, government reports, or news articles on obesity rates and health outcomes.


### 2. Select Two Layers of the Socio-Ecological (SE) Model
- The SE model considers health influences at multiple levels. You must choose two different layers for your analysis. Here are the main layers and examples of possible factors for each:

#### a) Individual
	- Personal knowledge, attitudes, beliefs
	- Age, sex, genetics, ethnicity
	- Socioeconomic status (SES)
	- Health behaviors (diet, exercise, smoking)

#### b) Interpersonal
	- Family influences
	- Peer groups and social networks
	- Social support or pressure

#### c) Institutional
	- Access to facilities, goods, and services within organizations (e.g., workplace, school)
	- Living and working conditions
	- Institutional policies and regulations

#### d) Community
	- Access to healthcare, healthy food, safe spaces
	- Community education and norms
	- Sociocultural values, economic and political influences

#### e) Policy/Societal
	- National or local policies and laws
	- Public health regulations
	- Broader social, economic, and political context

- **Hint:** Review your lecture notes for more details on each layer. Choose layers where you can find strong evidence or examples relevant to Singapore's context.

### 3. Identify and Explain Two Reasons (One per Layer)
- For each chosen layer, identify a factor that contributes to adult obesity in Singapore.
- Explain each reason in detail, using evidence and examples.
- **Hint:** For the individual layer, consider personal habits or knowledge. For the community layer, think about the built environment or access to healthy food.

### 4. Use Evidence and Real-Life Examples
- Support your explanations with data, case studies, or scholarly sources.
- **Hint:** Try to find at least one Singapore-specific example for each reason.

### 5. Structure Your Response
- Introduction: Summarize why obesity is a public health concern and outline your two reasons.
- Body: Two paragraphs, each explaining one reason linked to a specific SE model layer.
- Conclusion: Reiterate the significance of the issue.
- Indicate word count for each section.

### 6. Reference Properly
- Use APA style for all citations and references.
- **Hint:** Keep track of your sources as you research.

## Task 2: Evaluating the Most Significant Reason

### 1. Review All Groups’ Reasons
- Read the reasons posted by your group and others in your cluster.
- **Hint:** Make a table summarizing each group’s reasons and the SE model layer they belong to.

### 2. Choose the Most Significant Reason
- Decide which reason (from any group) is most important for adult obesity in Singapore.
- **Hint:** Consider which factor has the broadest or deepest impact.

### 3. Write a Critical Evaluation
- Explain why your chosen reason is more significant than the others.
- Discuss the interplay of SE model layers and compare/contrast the reasons.
- Use evidence and data to support your argument.
- **Hint:** Look for studies or reports that highlight the impact of your chosen factor.

### 4. Structure Your Response
- Table: Summarize all reasons and their SE model layers (excluded from word count).
- Introduction: State your chosen reason.
- Body: Critically evaluate and compare reasons.
- Conclusion: Summarize the significance of your chosen reason.
- Indicate word count for each section.

### 5. Reference Properly
- Use APA style for all citations and references.

	- Only one Canvas post per group; first post is final.

- **Table Requirement (Task 2):**
	- Before your essay, include a table summarizing all groups’ reasons and SE model layers (one sentence per reason, not point form; table is excluded from word count).

- **Diagrams:**
	- Max four diagrams (charts, figures, maps, tables, etc.) per paper (not required).
	- No diagram of the SE model allowed. No appendix or supplementary figures.
	- Diagrams must be labeled and cited; captions are not included in word count.

- **Declaration on Generative AI:**
