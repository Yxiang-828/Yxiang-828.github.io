# Critique of "Revolutionising Our Renewables" Project Proposal

## Paragraph 1: Relevance of Information
The relevance of the information presented in the proposal is questionable, as it fails to connect Singapore's specific energy challenges to global renewable trends effectively. While the document cites sources like the National Climate Change Secretariat and Ritchie et al., it overlooks broader international comparisons that could strengthen the argument. For instance, the claim about Singapore's high CO2 emissions per capita (50 metric tons) is presented without context against countries like Qatar (over 40 tons) or the UAE (around 20 tons), making the issue seem more isolated than it is. This lack of comparative data reduces the persuasiveness of the environmental harm argument. Furthermore, the energy security section relies heavily on local statistics but ignores how ASEAN neighbors like Malaysia have diversified their energy mix, potentially offering transferable lessons. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2023), Singapore's over-reliance on imports is not unique, and solutions like regional energy grids could provide better security than domestic renewables alone. Thus, the information's relevance is undermined by its narrow focus, limiting the proposal's ability to convince stakeholders of the urgency and feasibility.

## Paragraph 2: Accuracy of Assumptions
The accuracy of the assumptions underlying the purpose statement is flawed, particularly regarding the viability of doubling renewables from 2% to 4% in Singapore's energy mix. The proposal assumes that renewable technologies can seamlessly integrate into urban design despite land scarcity and high population density, but this overlooks practical constraints. For example, the suggestion of solar panels on HDBs (Housing Development Board flats) is optimistic, yet studies show that rooftop solar in dense urban environments yields only 10-20% of potential due to shading and orientation issues (Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore, 2022). Additionally, the claim that renewables can "make up for construction and operational costs" ignores economic realities; the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for solar in Singapore remains higher than imported LNG at $0.15-0.20/kWh versus $0.08/kWh (IEA, 2023). This inaccuracy stems from assuming technological advancements will automatically overcome local barriers, without accounting for Singapore's unique geography. External data from the World Bank (2023) indicates that countries with similar constraints, like Hong Kong, have struggled to exceed 5% renewables despite investments, proving the proposal's assumptions overly optimistic and potentially misleading.

## Paragraph 3: Depth of Concepts
The depth of the concepts in the proposal is commendable, as it thoroughly explores the multifaceted nature of Singapore's energy challenges, integrating environmental, economic, and security dimensions. By addressing climate change impacts like rising temperatures and sea levels alongside resource depletion and energy security, the document demonstrates a nuanced understanding of sustainability. The clear distinction between non-renewable harms and renewable viability adds conceptual rigor, avoiding superficial treatment. For example, the purpose section's emphasis on urban integration (e.g., HDB solar panels) shows deep consideration of local constraints, fostering innovative thinking. This depth enhances the proposal's intellectual foundation, making it more robust and adaptable for real-world implementation.
