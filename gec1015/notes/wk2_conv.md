What is Public Health?
Public Health is the “science
and art of preventing disease,
prolonging life, and promoting
health through the organized
efforts” and informed choices
of society, organizations,
public and private
communities, and individuals.
Prof C.E.A. Winslow (1920), SPH, Yale University

The Public Health Approach
1.Monitoring and
Surveillance
What is the
problem?
2. Identify risk and
protective factors
What are the
causes?
3. Develop and evaluate
interventions
What works and for
whom?
4. Implementation
Scaling up effective
policy and
programmes

1. What is the problem?
Monitoring and Surveillance
Requires the collection, analysis, and
interpretation of data to detect and define the
problem and outline:

2. What are the causes?
Identify risk and protective factors
• Why is there this problem?
• Requires a determination of:
–Preventable or not preventable
–Controllable or not controllable
–Priority
The Public Health Approach

## Page 11

3. How do we mitigate or prevent the
problem?
Develop and evaluate interventions
The potential for prevention or control
frequently requires:
–A strategy/method
–A champion
–Funding
The Public Health Approach

## Page 12

4. Has our solution worked?
Implementation
After implementation the cycle begins again, to
evaluate the program results.
– Did the strategy work as intended?
– Were the results as expected?
– If yes, can you expand or replicate the
program?
– If no, do you abandon or revise and try again?

The data outlines the problem to be:
• A barrier problem (none, failed or
inadequate)
• Supervision failure

## Page 18

Drowning in Arizona
• The Goal!
–One of the health objectives targeted
in Arizona 2000 was to decrease the
death rate for drowning to
1.3/100,000.
• The 1996 drowning rate for Arizona
residents of all ages exceeded the target
rate by 69%.
Note: The highest age specific drowning rate is for children under 5 years of age.
(Ref: Injury Mortality Among Arizona Residents, 1990-2000, Arizona Dept of Health Services)

Results:
• The legislature passed a bill in 1991
requiring fencing and buyer notification
(A.R.S. §36-1681)
• Education programs were developed and
implemented by realtors and volunteer
groups

Drowning in Arizona
• What happened?
• We have to return to data collection and
analysis to seek the answers

## Page 26

Drowning in Arizona
The findings show:
–Failure to use or maintain barriers
–Failure to supervise; parental inattention
–No requirement for interior pools
–Not all drowning occur in swimming pools

And so, the cycle begins again until we
accomplish our goal.

“Health is affected by the interaction between
the characteristics of the individual, the
community, and the environment that includes
physical, social and political components.”

The Socio-Ecological Model
The SE model helps us look at the determinants
of health at different levels of human interaction
with the environment.
The SE model may be used for:
• Understanding environmental influences on
behaviour
• Targeting/modifying these influences for
public health interventions
