# Taiona Gear Hammering Strategies

## Case A — Long Term: Get 3 Distinct Good Stats Each with a Good Level (Ultimate/Complete Build)

### Best Strategy (Step-by-Step):

1. Recast slot 3 (the 30% slot) repeatedly until it shows any desired stat (priority order: atk_spd > crit (either) == m.dmg > all_dmg > bloodsoul).
If you have a duo crit (crit_rate and crit_dmg) it may be equivalent to atk_spd in value.

1. When you get a desired type in S3, lock that type (pay 1 hammer for the lock). Don't care about level yet.

2. Recast slot 2 until it yields a desired type that is not the same as slot 3's type.

3. When it does, lock slot 2's type (pay 1 hammer).

4. Recast slot 1 until it yields the remaining desired type.

5. Unlock all (free). Now you have the three desired types assigned to the three slots.

6. Global refine until one of these 3 slots reach level 11–15, lock and continue.

### Optional:
- If one slot accidentally reaches a high level early and you want to freeze it, you could lock it — but that typically raises expected total cost; I generally do not lock during the refine run.

## Case B — Short Term: Get 2 Distinct Good Stats (Fast/Temporary) with Good Levels

### Goal:
- Get two top stats quickly with good levels now (you'll upgrade the third later).

### Best Strategy (Step-by-Step):

1. Recast slot 3 until it shows either atk_spd or a crit (crit_rate OR crit_dmg). When it does, lock that type (1 hammer).

2. Recast slot 2 until it shows the other desired stat (if S3 became atk_spd, get a crit in S2; if S3 became crit, get atk_spd in S2). When found, lock S2 (1 hammer).

2.5. Make sure at least one of the stat is atk_spd. Unless its a duo: crit_rate and crit_dmg

3. Unlock everything (free). (We do not lock during refine.)

4. Global refine until one of these 3 slots reach level 11–15, lock and continue.

Note: It is optimal to lock the first 2 stat types you get but beware that if you were to get s1 and s3, and then refine them, getting a good 2nd slot when you decide to focus on it for long term will be way harder.
