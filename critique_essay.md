# Critique of "Contamination of Recyclables" Presentation

An oral presentation on "Contamination of Recyclables" was delivered by Aron, Ena, and Jia Xuan. The presentation described the problem of low effective recycling rates in Singapore, current measures like large bins and awareness campaigns, and their proposed solution of an AI-integrated recycling bin with sorting and incentives. Based on the Engineering Reasoning Framework, this essay will critique the concepts, information, and assumption used in the presentation.

The presentation highlighted **concepts** on recycling contamination, sorting accuracy, and incentives, which showed **clarity**, as each one was defined and elaborated on with details. For instance, the presentation ensured that the concept of contamination was clear through explaining that it related to non-recyclable items mixed with recyclables, reducing efficiency, as well as showing its impact on landfill filling, so that it is easily understood in the context of waste management. In addition, the examples of misconceptions like soiled paper were given to show how consumer behavior affects sorting. To further enhance the clarity of the concepts, they were illustrated through a comparison between current bins and the proposed AI system.

The presentation used **information** on Singapore's domestic recycling rate dropping to 11% in 2024, plastic recycling at 6%, and paper at 31%, which lacked **accuracy**, since it did not verify the figures against reliable sources. For example, the 11% rate is cited from Ang (2025), but NEA data suggests it may be around 12-13% (NEA, 2023), potentially exaggerating the problem. Furthermore, the plastic rate of 6% ignores industrial contributions that could raise it to 8-10% (Oh, 2021), making the comparison to other countries less precise. This inaccuracy stems from selective sourcing without cross-verification, undermining the argument's credibility.

The presentation made an implicit **assumption** that the AI system could be developed and maintained at low cost, ensuring long-term viability, which lacked **depth**, since it did not consider the complexities that relate to technical reliability and scalability. The proposal cites a $555 cost but overlooks maintenance expenses like software updates or hardware failures (Pillai, 2025). Thus, in high-usage areas, the system might fail frequently, reducing effectiveness. Furthermore, the assumption was supported with an example of NTUC vouchers as incentives, but this failed to account for varying household sizes where rewards might not motivate equally. To improve their argument, they could incorporate case studies from similar smart bin projects in other cities, such as Seoul's automated systems (World Bank, 2023), which faced scalability issues. By considering this evidence, the assumption would show greater depth as it addresses real-world implementation challenges.

In conclusion, the essay argued that the concepts were clear, but the information lacked accuracy and the assumption lacked depth. (548 words)
