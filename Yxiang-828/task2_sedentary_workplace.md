## Table: Reasons from Group Cluster (excluded from 800-word count)

| Group | Reason (i) | Layer (i) | Reason (ii) | Layer (ii) |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 33 | Sedentary lifestyles are reinforced by Singapore's built environment and work culture, which reduce incidental physical activity and active commuting. | Community | Peer influence and social dining norms normalize frequent consumption of calorie-dense foods. | Interpersonal |
| 34 | Sedentary workplace routines and long working hours reduce opportunities for exercise and healthy eating. | Community | Peer influence and social media food trends encourage indulgent, less nutritious food choices. | Interpersonal |
| 35 | Preferences for convenience and comfort, together with nutritional knowledge gaps, lead to regular unhealthy eating patterns. | Individual | A work-centric culture normalises long hours and reliance on convenience foods, reinforcing sedentary behaviour. | Community |
| 36 | Complacent attitudes and misperception of personal risk reduce motivation for preventive behaviours. | Individual | An ingrained sedentary culture in white-collar workplaces (long hours, inflexible arrangements) fosters prolonged sitting and inactivity. | Institutional |

## a) Introduction

Workplace sedentary culture—characterised by long hours, prolonged sitting, and inflexible work arrangements—is the most significant contributor to adult obesity in Singapore because it creates sustained, population‑level exposure to physical inactivity and shapes eating patterns through time scarcity and work-related social norms (Leu et al., 2023; Ministry of Manpower, 2023). This structural driver constrains individual agency and amplifies other risk factors across the socio-ecological model. [Word count: 61]


## Categorisation of all eight reasons (one sentence each)

- Group 33 (Reason i, Community): Singapore's built environment and work culture reduce incidental physical activity and active commuting, promoting sedentary lifestyles across communities.
- Group 33 (Reason ii, Interpersonal): Peer influence and social dining norms normalise frequent consumption of calorie-dense foods during shared meals.
- Group 34 (Reason i, Community): Sedentary workplace routines and long working hours limit opportunities for exercise and reduce time for healthy meal preparation.
- Group 34 (Reason ii, Interpersonal): Social media and peer-driven food trends encourage indulgent and highly processed food choices among social networks.
- Group 35 (Reason i, Individual): Individual preferences for convenience and comfort, compounded by nutritional knowledge gaps, lead to routine consumption of unhealthy snacks and meals.
- Group 35 (Reason ii, Community): A work-centric community norm prioritising productivity over health increases reliance on convenience foods and reduces active living.
- Group 36 (Reason i, Individual): Complacent attitudes and misperceptions of personal risk decrease motivation for preventive behaviours such as regular exercise and dietary restraint.
- Group 36 (Reason ii, Institutional): Institutionalised sedentary culture in white-collar workplaces—long hours, inflexible schedules and presenteeism—creates prolonged daily exposure to inactivity.

## b) Evaluation

This evaluation compares workplace sedentary culture with the seven other reasons listed by the cluster and explains why workplace sedentary culture is the single most significant contributor to adult obesity in Singapore. I organise the comparison across four criteria: (1) population exposure and chronicity, (2) proximate causal pathways (activity and diet), (3) cross-layer amplification within the socio-ecological model, and (4) modifiability and policy leverage.

Population exposure and chronicity: institutional sedentary work affects a very large share of adults for prolonged daily periods, creating continuous exposure to low energy expenditure. In contrast, interpersonal drivers (peer dining, social media trends) and episodic behaviours (occasional indulgence) occur intermittently; biological predispositions are constant but do not change exposure. Because obesity accumulates over years, a ubiquitous daily exposure—like prolonged sitting at work—has greater cumulative impact on population-level weight gain than episodic influences [cite].

Proximate causal pathways: workplace sedentary culture reduces non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) across the working population while simultaneously increasing time scarcity that promotes convenient, calorie-dense food choices. Built-environment effects (reduced active commuting) and individual knowledge gaps primarily affect a single pathway (either activity or intake) or operate sporadically; the workplace concurrently depresses energy expenditure and elevates energy intake, yielding a stronger net positive energy balance per unit time.

Cross-layer amplification: workplaces are institutional nodes that shape interpersonal norms (team lunches, after-work gatherings), community patterns (commuting, local food demand), and individual behaviours (sleep, stress, time use). For example, a culture of presenteeism normalises skipped breaks and late-night eating—mechanisms that turn social norms into daily practices. Policy measures limited to labelling (Nutri-Grade) or health campaigns rely on individual uptake and therefore have weaker immediate influence on daily routines compared with organisational policy changes within workplaces.

Modifiability and leverage: compared with genetic/hormonal factors which are non-modifiable at population scale, workplace practices are organisationally modifiable and economically incentivised: employers can implement scheduling, environment, and canteen changes that reduce sitting time and improve food quality. Evidence shows flexible work and employer-led movement programmes can lower sitting time and influence BMI trends (Nakatsuka et al., 2022; Waters et al., 2016). Policy actions focused only on individual choice or single-product regulation have narrower effects than institutional reforms that change time use across the workforce.

Comparison summary: while peer influence, social media, built environment, knowledge gaps, complacency, and limited food policy each contribute, they are either episodic, target a single causal pathway, or are harder to scale quickly. Workplace sedentary culture uniquely meets all four criteria: widespread exposure, dual impact on activity and diet, cross-layer amplification, and practical modifiability. Thus, it is the most significant reason among the eight identified by the group cluster. [Word count: 663]


## c) Conclusion

Workplace sedentary culture is the key structural driver of adult obesity in Singapore because it creates continuous exposure to inactivity, drives compensatory dietary behaviours through time scarcity and social norms, and amplifies individual susceptibilities; addressing work organisation therefore yields the greatest potential for population-level impact.
