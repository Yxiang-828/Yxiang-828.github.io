# Academic Note-Taking Master Guide
*Instructions for Creating Comprehensive Academic Notes*

## Core Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Structure (Outline Method + Cornell Hybrid)
- **Main Topics**: Use clear headings (##)
- **Subtopics**: Use subheadings (###) 
- **Details**: Use bullet points with proper indentation
- **Supporting Info**: Use nested bullets and sub-bullets

### 2. Mathematical/Technical Content Standards
- **Definitions**: Always in bold or highlighted boxes
- **Theorems/Propositions**: Clearly labeled and numbered
- **Formulas**: Properly formatted with explanations
- **Examples**: Step-by-step with clear solutions
- **Proofs**: Logical flow with clear reasoning

### 3. Visual Organization
- **Boxing Method**: Group related concepts in visual sections
- **Color Coding**: Use consistent formatting for different elements
- **Tables/Charts**: For comparisons and systematic organization
- **Whitespace**: Proper spacing for readability
