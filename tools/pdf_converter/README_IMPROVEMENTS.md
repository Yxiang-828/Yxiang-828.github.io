```

2. **Mathematical Content**
```python
def extract_formulas(page):
    # Identify mathematical expressions
    # Preserve special characters and symbols
    # Maintain equation structure
```

3. **Citation Handling**
```python
def extract_references(text):
    # Identify bibliography sections
    # Parse citation formats (APA, IEEE, etc.)
    # Link in-text citations to references
```
