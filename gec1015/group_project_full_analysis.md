## Section 1: Project Instructions (with Direct Answers)

### 1. Why is adult obesity a public health concern in Singapore?
- **Answer:**
  - Obesity rates among Singaporean adults have risen from 8.6% (2013) to 11.6% (2022), signaling a growing epidemic.
  - Obesity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers) that burden Singapore’s healthcare system and economy.
  - The economic cost is substantial, with increased healthcare spending and productivity loss.
  - Obesity also impacts quality of life and increases mortality risk, making it a critical public health issue.

### 2. Using the Socio-Ecological Model: Two Reasons (Individual & Policy Layers)

#### a) Individual Layer – Biological and Behavioral Determinants
- **Answer:**
  - Genetics and hormonal regulation play a significant role in obesity risk, beyond personal willpower.
  - Some individuals have a biological predisposition to higher appetite or lower satiety, making weight management more difficult.
  - In Singapore, sedentary lifestyles and high-calorie diets further exacerbate individual risk.
  - Evidence: Case studies (e.g., Michael’s lifelong struggle) and research on GLP-1 agonists show that medical intervention is sometimes necessary, not just lifestyle change.

#### b) Policy Layer – Lack of Comprehensive Policy Support
- **Answer:**
  - Singapore’s current approach is largely self-funded, with limited insurance or public subsidy for obesity treatment.
  - In contrast, countries like the UK and Japan have implemented policies (e.g., subsidized medication, food taxes, public health campaigns) that have reduced obesity rates.
  - The absence of strong policy support in Singapore limits access to effective treatments and preventive measures, perpetuating the obesity epidemic.
  - Policy interventions can create environments that support healthy choices for all, not just individuals.

### 3. Evidence and Real-Life Examples
- **Answer:**
  - Use Singapore’s rising obesity statistics and economic impact as local evidence.
  - Reference international examples (UK NHS, Japan’s public health policies) to show the effectiveness of policy interventions.
  - Cite the case study of Michael and research on new medications to illustrate the complexity of individual-level factors.

### 4. Structure and Formatting
- **Answer:**
  - Introduction: Define the public health concern, present statistics, and outline the two SE model layers chosen.
  - Body: Two paragraphs, each focused on one SE model layer and reason, with evidence and analysis.
  - Conclusion: Reiterate the significance of obesity and the need for multi-level solutions.
  - Indicate word count for each section (excluding in-text citations).
  - Use APA style for all citations and references.
  - No cover page; group number and member names in header.
  - Submit as Word doc, correct folder, titled 'Group#'.
  - Canvas post for Task 1 must be in essay format (not attachment) and include references; only one post per group.

### 5. Table Requirement (Task 2)
- **Answer:**
  - Before the essay, include a table summarizing all groups’ reasons and SE model layers (one sentence per reason, not point form; table is excluded from word count).

### 6. Diagrams
- **Answer:**
  - Up to four diagrams allowed per paper (not required).
  - No diagram of the SE model; no appendix.
  - Diagrams must be labeled and cited; captions are not included in word count.

### 7. Declaration on Generative AI
- **Answer:**
  - At the end of both tasks, declare if you used any AI platform. If not, use the provided statement. If yes, specify the platform, purpose, prompts, and how you used the results.

### 8. Late Submission, Plagiarism, and Peer Review
- **Answer:**
  - Late penalties: <6h (-10%), 6–12h (-20%), 12–24h (-50%), >24h (zero marks).
  - Plagiarism penalties: -1 to -7 points, or more severe action for >25%.
  - Peer review moderates final marks (due with Task 2).

## Section 2: Analytical Depth – Applying the SE Model

### Socio-Ecological Model Definitions
- **Individual Layer:** Personal characteristics (genetics, knowledge, attitudes, behaviors) that influence health.
- **Policy Layer:** Laws, regulations, and public policies that shape health environments and access to resources.

### Task 1: Analytical Application

#### Introduction
- Obesity is a growing public health crisis in Singapore, with rising prevalence and significant health and economic consequences.
- The SE model helps analyze how both individual and policy factors drive this trend.

#### Individual Layer Analysis
- Genetics and biology can predispose individuals to obesity, making prevention and treatment more complex than simply “eating less and moving more.”
- Behavioral factors (diet, physical activity) are shaped by knowledge, attitudes, and cultural norms.
- Medical advances (e.g., GLP-1 agonists) show that some cases require clinical intervention, not just lifestyle change.
- In Singapore, urban lifestyles and food culture contribute to unhealthy behaviors, but not all individuals have equal biological risk.

#### Policy Layer Analysis
- Policy gaps in Singapore (e.g., lack of insurance/subsidy for obesity treatment) limit access to effective interventions.
- International evidence shows that policy action (e.g., food taxes, public health campaigns, subsidized medication) can reduce obesity rates at the population level.
- Policy can shape environments, making healthy choices easier and more accessible for all.
- Without strong policy support, individual efforts are often insufficient to reverse the obesity epidemic.

#### Conclusion
- Both individual and policy factors are critical in understanding and addressing adult obesity in Singapore.
- Sustainable solutions require coordinated action at multiple levels, with policy enabling and supporting individual change.

## Section 3: Task 2 – Evaluation and Critical Comparison

### Table (Before Essay, Excluded from Word Count)
| Group | Reason | SE Model Layer |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1     | [Sentence summarizing reason 1] | Individual |
| 1     | [Sentence summarizing reason 2] | Policy     |
| ...   | ...    | ...           |

### Introduction
- State which reason is most significant and its SE model layer.

### Evaluation
- Critically compare the chosen reason to others, using evidence and analysis.
- Discuss how policy can enable or limit individual change, and why policy-level action may have broader impact.
- Use Singapore-specific and international evidence to support your argument.

### Conclusion
- Summarize why your chosen reason is most significant and the importance of multi-level solutions.
