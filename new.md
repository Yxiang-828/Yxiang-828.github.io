## Task 2 Essay: Most Significant Reason for Adult Obesity in Singapore



## Group Summaries

### 1. Group 34
- **Key Points**: Obesity is a rising public health issue in Singapore, doubling in prevalence over 30 years (from ~5.5% to 11.6% in 2022), linked to chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, CVD, cancer), economic costs (e.g., healthcare strain, productivity loss), and an aging population. The essay argues for collective action at individual, community, and policy levels to address it.
- **Reasons for Obesity**:
  - **Community layer**: Sedentary lifestyles reinforced by built environment (e.g., efficient public transport reducing walking, food delivery apps increasing calorie-dense food access) and work culture (e.g., long hours reducing exercise time, prioritizing productivity over health).
  - **Interpersonal layer**: Peer influence shaping dietary habits (e.g., social dining norms, social media food trends amplifying unhealthy choices).
- **SE Model Used**: Community Layer and Interpersonal Layer.
- **Word Count/Structure**: Intro (383 words), Community (303), Interpersonal (307), Conclusion (104), References, AI Declaration.

### 2. Group 33
- **Key Points**: Obesity is a complex disease increasing risks of chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, CVD, hypertension) and economic burdens (e.g., $178M+ in healthcare costs for older adults). It requires addressing individual biological risks and policy gaps, with Singapore's Nutri-Grade system as a partial solution.
- **Reasons for Obesity**:
  - **Individual level**: Biological determinants (e.g., genetics like FTO gene, hormonal imbalances like leptin resistance, ethnic-specific fat storage in South Asians) amplified by behavioral factors (e.g., sedentary lifestyles from long work hours and productivity focus).
  - **Policy level**: Lack of comprehensive regulation on food markets (e.g., Nutri-Grade only covers beverages, not sodium-heavy foods like sauces/noodles; doesn't account for all nutrients or artificial sweeteners).
- **SE Model Used**: Individual Level and Policy Level.
- **Word Count/Structure**: Intro (352), Individual (709), Policy (N/A - integrated), Conclusion (132), References, AI Declaration.

### 3. Group 36
- **Key Points**: Obesity affects metabolism and energy storage, increasing chronic disease risks (e.g., diabetes, CVD) and economic costs (e.g., $261M annually). It requires multifactorial interventions, with Singapore's rising rates (11.6% in 2022) threatening healthcare and productivity.
- **Reasons for Obesity**:
  - **Individual level**: Complacent attitudes (e.g., over-reliance on healthcare system reducing preventive urgency, prioritizing work over health, misperception of personal risk leading to unhealthy choices).
  - **Institutional level**: Sedentary culture in white-collar workplaces (e.g., long hours/high workload limiting breaks/exercise, inflexible arrangements reducing remote work benefits, ineffective health programs not tailored to needs).
- **SE Model Used**: Individual Level and Institutional Level.
- **Word Count/Structure**: Intro (176), Individual (493), Institutional (486), Conclusion (41), References, AI Declaration.

### 4. Group 35
- **Key Points**: Obesity drives global health issues (e.g., diabetes, metabolic diseases) and burdens Singapore's healthcare (e.g., 50% of diabetes burden, $261M costs, projected 1M cases by 2050). Rising rates (11.6% in 2022) require addressing individual preferences and community norms.
- **Reasons for Obesity**:
  - **Individual layer**: Preferences/beliefs favoring convenience/comfort (e.g., replacing meals with snacks, occasional indulgence, perceived control via exercise); knowledge gaps/misconceptions (e.g., underestimating calories, misinterpreting labels).
  - **Community layer**: Work-centric culture (e.g., long hours promoting sedentariness, reliance on calorie-dense convenience foods, "wealth over health" values prioritizing career over well-being).
- **SE Model Used**: Individual Layer and Community Layer.
- **Word Count/Structure**: Intro (279), Individual (389), Community (394), Conclusion (134), References, AI Declaration (none used).

## Categorization

### By SE Model Layers Used
- **Individual + Community/Interpersonal**: Groups 34 (Community + Interpersonal) and 35 (Individual + Community) - Focus on personal behaviors and social/environmental influences.
- **Individual + Higher-Level (Institutional/Policy)**: Groups 33 (Individual + Policy) and 36 (Individual + Institutional) - Emphasize systemic/organizational factors alongside personal ones.

### By Primary Themes
- **Lifestyle/Behavioral Focus**: Groups 34, 35, 36 - Stress sedentary habits, work culture, peer influence, and personal attitudes.
- **Biological/Policy Focus**: Group 33 - Unique emphasis on genetics/hormones and regulatory gaps (e.g., Nutri-Grade).

### By AI Usage
- Groups 34, 33, 36 declared AI use (e.g., ChatGPT for research/sources).
- Group 35 declared none.

### Overall Trends
- All groups highlight Singapore-specific contexts (e.g., work hours, food culture, healthcare system).
- Essays are ~1,200 words, with strong evidence from sources like MOH reports and studies.
- Common calls for policy/individual interventions to combat rising obesity.
