Sample body paragraph Notes

“The proposal demonstrated accuracy in its description of
biosensor technology. The device was reported to provide
results within 15 minutes, with 98% accuracy, reducing
diagnostic errors by 40% (Kulsing, et.al, 2024). These claims
were substantiated by field trials, demonstrating
improvements over traditional methods. Additionally, the
device’s offline functionality and solar-powered capability
address infrastructural limitations, reinforcing the practicality
of the solution. The use of solar power is particularly
significant in rural areas where power supply can be
inconsistent. The fact that the device works offline ensures
that it can be used even in remote locations with limited
connectivity. These features make the technology
particularly promising in resource-constrained settings.”
“The team supports their claims with multiple sources, citing
organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO)
and Mongolian government reports. However, the accuracy
of the evidence is inconsistent. While some data points are
well-supported, such as the statistic that 70% of deaths
occur outside hospitals (Sainbayar et al., 2023), other claims
lack precise references. For example, the statement that
“EMS response time in rural areas is significantly longer than
the recommended 8 minutes” does not provide a clear
benchmark for comparison. Additionally, the cost evaluation
of medical helicopters ($400K to $18M) is presented without
considering maintenance costs and the feasibility of
integration into Mongolia’s existing healthcare system. To
improve the accuracy of their argument, they could use a
wider range of evidence and ensure a comprehensive and
precise data validation.”

Body Paragraph 1 Critique
**Strengths:**
The paragraph's concepts are clear and well-organized, providing a logical flow of information. The use of specific statistics (e.g., 98% accuracy, 40% reduction in diagnostic errors) adds credibility to the argument. The paragraph effectively highlights the practical features of the biosensor technology, such as offline functionality and solar power, which are particularly relevant for resource-constrained settings.
