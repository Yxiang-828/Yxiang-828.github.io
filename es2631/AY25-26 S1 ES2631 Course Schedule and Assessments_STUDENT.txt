I. Course Assessment
Students are assessed through group and individual work as follows:
Group (30%)
● Assignment 1: Team oral presentation [8-9 min + 7 min Q&A] - 30%
Individual (70%)
● Assignment 2: Critique of design [500-600 words] - 25%
● Assignment 3: Critique of article [500-600 words] - 25%
● Quizzes - 10% (Quizzes 1-5)
Important: Each quiz should ideally be taken after reviewing the materials for the week and
before the week’s tutorial. You can attempt each quiz only once, so please make sure you are
in a quiet place, your internet connection is stable, and your laptop fully charged or
connected to a power outlet before you start. You must click ‘submit quiz’ upon completion
of the quiz or your answers will not be saved.
Class participation - 10%
This involves preparation, punctual arrival and active participation in both in-class and
online activities and discussions. It also involves submitting all work on time.

II. Referencing
You are required to cite all your sources appropriately and include a generative AI use
declaration with every assignment you submit.
In this course, we will use the APA citation style (7th edition) for all assignments:
https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide
/index.html
Note that plagiarism and unethical use of AI are serious offences. Any instance of
plagiarism or unethical use of AI will be reported to the appropriate administrative and
academic departments for review and could have very severe consequences for your
academic career. Hence, please review the information below as well as the
lecture/video/slides on Source Selection, Integration and Attribution before you submit
your assignments:
(a) NUS Policy on Plagiarism
The NUS Policy on Plagiarism can be found at:
https://myportal.nus.edu.sg/studentportal/student-discipline/all/docs/NUS-Plagiarism-
Policy.pdf
(b) Excerpts from NUS Interim AI Use Policy
Extracts relevant to a critical thinking and expression course like ES2631 from the NUS
Interim AI Use Policy have been reproduced below for your reference. As stated in the
policy document (p.4), the following are always improper uses of AI tools:
• Generating an output and presenting it as your own work or idea.
• Generating a draft output that is then paraphrased and presented as your own work or
idea.
• Processing an original source not created by yourself to plagiarize it (e.g., using an AI
paraphrasing tool to disguise someone else’s original work, or even the output of
another AI tool, and then presenting the final output as your own work or idea).
All of the above violate NUS policies on academic dishonesty and anyone found to have
done any of them will be dealt with accordingly.
The same document lists the limitations of using the current generation of AI tools (p. 6):
• The quality of the output is dependent on the quality of the users’ prompts.
• Their output may be out of date, as they are dependent on the available training data.
• Their output is not always accurate (they don’t always present information that is true,
the ‘citations’ they may generate may be made-up and point to non-existent sources).
• Their output may only represent dominant values and opinions, rather than what is
objective.
• Their output is not always aligned with moral values (they sometimes present outputs
that are offensive or discriminatory).
(c) Making your AI use declaration:


--- Page 5 ---
5
The AI use policy document also provides instructions on how to cite and reference
information acquired through the use of generative AI (p. 5).
All submitted assignments for this course, including the slides for the Team OP, must
include the following declaration:
*I/We (insert full name or names) declare that *I/we *have/have not used generative
AI in the process of completing this assignment. If *I/we have used generative AI in
any way to complete the assignment, this use has been documented in an appendix
submitted with *my/our assignment.
*delete as appropriate
If you complete any work with the aid of an AI tool, you should always acknowledge the use.
Using the outputs of an AI tool without proper acknowledgement is equivalent to lifting or
paraphrasing a paragraph from a source without citing it and attracts the same sanctions.
You can provide this acknowledgement in an appendix at the end of the assignment
explaining which AI tools were used and what they were used, such as in which parts of
the process it was used, what prompts used to generate results, and what you did with the
outputs to add value. One way this can be done is in a tabular form as shown below:
AI Tool Used Prompt and output How the output is used in
the assignment
Alternatively, if an AI tool was used to generate a more extensive set of intermediate
outputs that were then developed into a final product, you should preserve a full
transcript of the relevant interactions with the AI as an appendix for submission with
your assignment.
III. Penalty for late submissions and exceeding the word count
• Please submit your assignments by the given deadlines.
• If there is a problem with CANVAS, you should take a screenshot of the error message
and send it to your tutor.
• Download a digital receipt from Turnitin which will show the date and time of your
submission. It will serve as evidence that you have submitted your assignment in the
event that your assignment cannot be found in Turnitin. Here are instructions on how to
download the receipt:
