## Quoting from Sources

### Keep Quotes Minimal
- Use direct quotations sparingly in your papers
- Quote impactful terms, concepts, or phrases only
- Avoid quoting entire sentences when possible
- Paraphrase whenever you can

### Three Ways to Quote:

#### 1. Lead-in Clause/Phrase
Introduce the quote and incorporate it into your sentence:
- Example: "In their recent article on Open AI's ChatGPT, Chomsky et al (2023) argue that such language learning models 'differ profoundly from how humans reason and use language.'"

#### 2. Interrupted Structure (for long quotes)
Break up long quotes to maintain readability:
- Example: "By emphasizing the basic moral identity and equality of human beings and animals," Calarco argues that the identity-based approach "calls for a fundamental rethinking of a whole host of human activities that impact animals in negative and harmful ways" (Calarco, 2011, p. 43).

#### 3. Quote + Closing Comment
Provide explanation after the quote:
- Example: By dismissing the film as "propaganda," Smith (2010) fails to consider its use of evidence from different sources to convey its point about the impacts of climate change.
