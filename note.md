# Critical Thinking Framework Summary


## The Intellectual Standards:

1. Clarity
1. Precision
1. Accuracy
1. Significance
1. Relevance

1. Logicalness
1. Fairness
1. Breadth
1. Depth


### Clarity
Clarity is the quality of being easily understood, free from confusion or ambiguity. In critical thinking, clarity is essential because if a statement or idea is unclear, it is impossible to assess its accuracy, relevance, significance, precision, logicalness, fairness, breadth, or depth. Clarity is the foundation for all other intellectual standards.

**Clarity vs. Precision:**
- Clarity is about being understandable and free from confusion or ambiguity. It is not about "more details." Instead, it means the idea is expressed in a way that can be grasped by others.
- Precision is about being specific and exact to the necessary level of detail. Precision adds the necessary details once clarity is achieved.

**How to achieve clarity:**
- Restate the idea in simpler terms
- Ask for examples or illustrations
- Request further explanation or elaboration

**Questions to promote clarity:**
- Can you elaborate on that point? (Note: This can also relate to depth if asking for more complexity)
- Could you give an example?
- Can you rephrase that in another way?

**Why clarity matters:**
Without clarity, communication breaks down and reasoning cannot proceed. Clear thinking ensures that everyone understands the issue or argument in the same way, which is necessary for meaningful discussion and problem-solving.

**Clarity as the Gateway Standard:**
Clarity is considered the gateway to all other intellectual standards because it creates understandability. If a statement is not clear, you cannot determine if it is accurate, relevant, significant, precise, logical, fair, broad, or deep. Only when an idea is clearly understood can you effectively apply the other standards to evaluate or build upon it. In this way, clarity enables meaningful analysis, discussion, and problem-solving.


### Accuracy
Accuracy means being free from errors, mistakes, or distortions. In critical thinking, accuracy ensures that information is true and correct. Without accuracy, conclusions and decisions may be based on false premises.

**Questions to ask:**
- Is that really true?
- How can we check that?
- How can we verify or test that?


### Relevance
Relevance means focusing on information and arguments that relate directly to the issue at hand. Relevant information helps address the question or problem; irrelevant information distracts from it.

**Questions to ask:**
- How does that relate to the problem?
- How does this help us with the issue?


### Logicalness
Logicalness means reasoning in a way that makes sense and follows from the evidence. Logicalness ensures that conclusions follow from premises and that arguments are coherent.

**Questions to ask:**
- Does this make sense?
- Does that follow from what you said?
- How does that conclusion follow?


### Breadth
Breadth means considering a range of perspectives or viewpoints. It involves looking at the issue from different angles and avoiding narrow thinking.

**How to promote breadth:**
Breadth can be encouraged by explicitly stating a term or phrase that signals consideration of all points of view. For example, starting with "From various perspectives..." or "Considering all sides of the issue..." helps remind us to include multiple viewpoints and avoid a narrow focus.

**Example:**
Instead of saying "This policy is effective," you could say "From the perspectives of both students and teachers, this policy has different effects."

**Questions to ask:**
- Do we need to look at this from another perspective?
- What would this look like from a different viewpoint?


### Precision
Precision means being specific and exact to the necessary level of detail. In critical thinking, precision avoids vagueness and generalities. Precision is not about "more details" in general, but about the right details that make a statement exact and unambiguous.

**Clarity vs. Precision:**
- Clarity comes first: Is the idea understandable?
- Precision comes next: Is the idea specific and exact enough for the context?

**Questions to ask:**
- Can you be more specific?
- Can you give more details?
- Can you be exact?


### Significance
Significance means focusing on the most important information, ideas, or issues. It helps prioritize what matters most in reasoning and decision-making. Significance is about importance, not about complexity.

**Significance vs. Depth:**
- Significance is about what is most important or impactful.
- Depth is about the complexity and underlying factors of an issue.

**How to apply significance:**
Significance is about deciding whether something is worth spending time and attention on. It helps you focus on what truly matters, especially when considering implications or consequences. When evaluating information or arguments, ask yourself if the point is central to the issue or if it will have meaningful impact.

**Example:**
When discussing a policy change, you might ask, "Is this implication significant enough to affect the outcome, or is it a minor detail?"

**Questions to ask:**
- Which of these facts are most important?
- What is the central idea?
- Why is this important?





### Fairness
Fairness means being just, impartial, and free from bias. In critical thinking, fairness requires considering all relevant viewpoints and treating them equally.

**Questions to ask:**
- Am I considering all relevant viewpoints?
- Is my thinking influenced by my interests or feelings?
- Am I being fair to others?


### Depth
Depth means addressing the complexities and underlying factors of an issue. A statement can be clear, accurate, precise, relevant, significant, logical, fair, and broad, but still lack depth if it only scratches the surface and ignores deeper causes, relationships, or implications. Depth requires exploring the underlying issues, recognizing complexities, and not settling for superficial explanations.

**Depth vs. Significance:**
- Depth is about complexity and the need to address underlying causes, relationships, or implications.
- Significance is about importance or impact.

**Example:**
A statement like "Exercise is good for health" is clear, accurate, precise, and relevant, but it lacks depth because it does not address how, why, or under what conditions exercise benefits health, or what types of exercise are most effective.

**Questions to promote depth:**
- What are the underlying causes?
- What makes this issue difficult?
- Are there complexities that need to be considered?

**Key point:**
Depth ensures that reasoning goes beyond the obvious and addresses the real substance and complexity of a problem or question.

## Linking Intellectual Standards to Proof of Concept

The intellectual standards (such as clarity, accuracy, relevance, and depth) are used to evaluate and refine ideas, arguments, or solutions. Once an idea has been thoroughly examined and meets these standards, the next step is to create a proof of concept. This is a practical demonstration or test that shows the idea can work in real-world conditions.

**Why is this link important?**
- Intellectual standards ensure your reasoning is strong and well-founded before you invest resources in testing or implementation.
- A proof of concept validates that your well-reasoned idea is feasible and effective in practice.

**Summary:**
First, use intellectual standards to critically assess and improve your idea. Then, use a proof of concept to demonstrate its practical value.

## Applying Intellectual Standards to Urban Transport Policy (Point of View Example)

**Clarity:**
Are the concerns and benefits of each group clearly stated? For example, do we understand exactly what "efficient and sustainable urban transport" means for government planners?

**Accuracy:**
Are the claims about costs, convenience, congestion, emissions, and business impact supported by reliable data or evidence?

**Relevance:**
Are all points directly related to the central issue of urban transport policy, or are some concerns less pertinent?

**Logicalness:**
Do the arguments and concerns logically follow from the perspectives presented? For example, does less congestion necessarily mean more crowding in public transport?

**Breadth:**
Are all relevant points of view considered (government, motorists, public transport users, environmentalists, businesses)? Is any important perspective missing?

**Precision:**
Are the statements specific enough? For example, what is meant by "extra cost" or "less customers"â€”how much, and to whom?

**Significance:**
Which concerns are most important for decision-making? Is the impact on emissions more significant than the inconvenience to motorists?

**Completeness:**
Are all aspects of the issue addressed, such as alternative transport options, long-term effects, and possible solutions?

**Fairness:**
Are all viewpoints treated impartially, without bias toward one group over another?

**Depth:**
Are the underlying causes and complexities explored, such as why congestion occurs, or what makes urban transport planning difficult?
