# Public Health Reading List Summary - GEC1015/GEH1049

## Week 2: Public Health Frameworks (Dr Cecilia Teng)

### McLeroy et al. (1988) - Ecological Perspective on Health Promotion Programs

**What it's about:** This foundational paper introduces the **Socio-Ecological Model** for understanding health behavior and designing health promotion programs.

**Key concept:** Health is influenced by multiple interconnected levels:
1. **Individual/Intrapersonal** - Personal factors (knowledge, attitudes, skills, behavior)
2. **Interpersonal** - Family, friends, social networks that provide social identity/support
3. **Institutional/Organizational** - Organizations and social institutions with formal/informal rules
4. **Community** - Relationships among organizations, institutions, and informal networks
5. **Policy** - Local, state, and national laws and policies

**Why it matters:** Instead of just focusing on individual behavior change, this model shows that effective health promotion must address multiple levels simultaneously. For example, to reduce smoking, you need individual education, family support, workplace policies, community programs, AND government regulations.

## Week 3: Introduction to Health Systems (Dr Ian Ang)

### Singapore Healthcare System Overview (Yoong, Lim & Lin, 2018 + Haseltine, 2013)

**What it's about:** These readings examine Singapore's unique healthcare system that achieves excellent health outcomes while spending less than other high-income countries.

**Key features of Singapore's system:**
- **Mixed financing:** Combines government subsidies, mandatory savings (Medisave), insurance (Medishield), and out-of-pocket payments
- **Political stability:** Long-term planning possible due to stable government since independence
- **Government control:** Strong central planning and regulation of healthcare delivery
- **Infrastructure design:** Integrated healthcare clusters, emphasis on primary care
- **Cost control:** Government actively manages healthcare costs while maintaining quality

**Why it's successful:**
1. **Long-term political unity** - Consistent healthcare vision across decades
2. **Clear national priorities** - Healthcare seen as essential for national development  
3. **Collective responsibility** - Balance between individual responsibility and government support

**Design principles:** The system emphasizes prevention, primary care, and cost-effectiveness while ensuring universal access through subsidies for those who need them.

## Week 3: Health Interventions (Dr Ian Ang)

### Frieden (2015) - The Future of Public Health

**What it's about:** This influential paper outlines the future direction of public health, emphasizing the need for collaboration between clinical medicine and public health.

**Key concepts:**
- **Health Impact Pyramid:** Most effective interventions are policy/environmental changes that affect entire populations (base of pyramid), followed by clinical interventions, health education, and counseling (top of pyramid)
- **Public Health 3.0:** Next evolution of public health that emphasizes cross-sector collaboration
- **Integration imperative:** Clinical medicine and public health must work together more closely

**Main arguments:**
1. **Population-level interventions** are more effective than individual-focused ones
2. **Multi-sector collaboration** is essential (government, healthcare, private sector, communities)
3. **Accountability for outcomes** - focus on measurable population health improvements
4. **Technology and data** can revolutionize how we track and improve health

**Future challenges:** Aging populations, chronic diseases, health inequities, climate change, and emerging infectious diseases require new approaches.

## Week 4: Introduction to Infectious Diseases (A/P Teo Yik Ying)

### Baker et al. (2021) - Infectious Disease in an Era of Global Change

**What it's about:** This comprehensive review examines how global changes (climate, demographics, globalization) are affecting infectious disease patterns worldwide.

**Key global changes affecting infectious diseases:**
1. **Climate change** - Altering disease vector distributions, seasonal patterns
2. **Urbanization** - Creating new transmission dynamics in dense populations  
3. **Globalization** - Enabling rapid disease spread across borders (like COVID-19)
4. **Demographic transitions** - Aging populations, changing disease susceptibility
5. **Land use changes** - Bringing humans into contact with new pathogens

**Examples covered:**
- **Vector-borne diseases:** Malaria, dengue expanding into new geographic areas
- **Respiratory diseases:** How climate affects transmission of influenza, COVID-19
- **Food/water-borne diseases:** Changing precipitation patterns affecting cholera, typhoid
- **Zoonotic diseases:** Deforestation increasing human-animal contact

**Implications:** Need for adaptive surveillance systems, global coordination, and climate-informed public health planning.

## Week 6: Nutrition, Diet and Health (A/Prof Mary Chong)

### Key Focus Areas (based on course listing):
- **Environmental approaches** to improving population nutrition
- **Policy interventions** for healthy food environments
- **Population-level strategies** for diet improvement
- Integration of nutrition policy with physical activity and smoking cessation

---

## Week 7: Substance Misuse and Toxicity (Dr Tan Yeong Lan)

### Key Focus Areas:
- **Substance use disorders** as medical conditions requiring healthcare response
- **Public health approaches** to substance misuse prevention and treatment
- **Healthcare system integration** for addressing addiction

---

## Week 8: Genomics in Public Health (Dr Rick Ong)

### Key Focus Areas:
- **National genomic projects** and their public health applications
- **Population-level genetic screening** programs
- **Ethical and policy considerations** in public health genomics

---

## Week 10: Introduction to Global Health Interventions (A/Prof Liow Chee Hsiang)

### Key Focus Areas:
- **Global health definition** and scope
- **International health interventions** and their effectiveness
- **Cross-border health collaboration**

---

## Week 11: Climate Change and Health Impacts (A/Prof Kimberly Fornace)

### Haines & Ebi (2019) + IPCC Chapter on Human Health

**What it's about:** These readings examine climate change as a fundamental threat to human health and the urgent need for action.

**Direct health impacts of climate change:**
1. **Heat-related illness** - Heat waves, heat stroke, cardiovascular stress
2. **Extreme weather events** - Injuries, mental health impacts from storms, floods
3. **Air quality changes** - Increased ozone, particulate matter, allergens
4. **Water security** - Drought, flooding affecting water quality and availability

**Indirect health impacts:**
1. **Food security** - Crop failures, malnutrition, food price volatility
2. **Infectious diseases** - Changing vector distributions, water-borne diseases
3. **Population displacement** - Climate refugees, overcrowding, conflict
4. **Economic impacts** - Healthcare costs, lost productivity

**IPCC findings:**
- **High confidence** that climate change is already affecting human health
- **Vulnerable populations** most at risk (elderly, children, poor, indigenous)
- **Adaptation strategies** needed immediately
- **Co-benefits** of climate action for health (cleaner air, active transport, healthier diets)

**Imperative for action:** The health argument provides compelling justification for urgent climate action, as the health co-benefits often outweigh the costs of climate mitigation.
