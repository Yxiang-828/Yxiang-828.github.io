    <h1>GEC1015 Public Health: Comprehensive Notes</h1>

    <h2>1. Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the roles of public health in daily life</li>
        <li>Define epidemiological, biological, and socioeconomic factors of diseases</li>
        <li>Explain what public health is and its multidisciplinary approach</li>
        <li>Master screening test metrics: sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Key Terminology &amp; Definitions</h2>

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p><b>Public Health</b>: Focuses on the population and prevention rather than the individual and treatment. It aims
        to improve health outcomes through organized efforts, policies, and interventions that address the broader
        determinants of health. It deals with the prevention and management of epidemics (IDs and NCDs), health
        promotion, and addressing social determinants of health.</p>

    <p><b>Fill-in-the-blank</b>: Public Health focuses on the <b>population and prevention</b> rather than on <b>patients and treatment</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Epidemiological Factors</b>: The distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specific
        populations. For example, understanding the incidence and prevalence of a disease can help identify high-risk
        groups and inform targeted interventions.</p>

    <p><b>Biological Factors</b>: The genetic, physiological, and pathological aspects of a disease that can influence
        its transmission and progression. For instance, knowledge about the mode of transmission (e.g., airborne,
        vector-borne) can guide prevention strategies.</p>

    <p><b>Socioeconomic Factors</b>: The social and economic conditions that affect individuals' health, such as income,
        education, and access to healthcare. These factors can create barriers to effective public health interventions,
        such as limited access to vaccines or healthcare services in low-income communities. Addressing these barriers
        through policies and programs is essential for successful public health outcomes.</p>

    <p><b>Infectious Diseases (IDs)</b>: Diseases that can be transmitted from one person to another (e.g., flu, HIV,
        COVID-19). Also known as communicable diseases.</p>

    <p><b>Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)</b>: Chronic diseases not transmitted person-to-person (e.g., diabetes, heart
        disease, cancer).</p>

    <p><b>Sensitivity</b>: True positive rate. Formula: Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN). Probability of test positive given
        infected.</p>

    <p><b>Specificity</b>: True negative rate. Formula: Specificity = TN / (TN + FP). Probability of test negative given
        not infected.</p>

    <p><b>Positive Predictive Value (PPV)</b>: Probability of being infected given a positive test. Formula: PPV = TP /
        (TP + FP).</p>

    <p><b>Negative Predictive Value (NPV)</b>: Probability of not being infected given a negative test. Formula: NPV =
        TN / (TN + FN).</p>

    <h3>Notation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A: Infected</li>
        <li>B: Test positive</li>
        <li>TP: True Positive (A ∩ B)</li>
        <li>TN: True Negative (A' ∩ B')</li>
        <li>FP: False Positive (A' ∩ B)</li>
        <li>FN: False Negative (A ∩ B')</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Conditional Probabilities</b>: Sensitivity = P(B|A) = b|a, Specificity = P(B'|A') = b'|a', PPV = P(A|B) = a|b, NPV = P(A'|B') = a'|b'.</p>

    <h2>Public Health Overview</h2>

    <p><b>What is public health?</b> = Science and art of creating a healthier environment for all.</p>

    <p><b>Focus on</b> population and prevention rather than on patients and treatment.</p>

    <p><b>Public health issues:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-communicable disease (NCD): Cannot spread, caused by unhealthy behaviors.</li>
        <li>Example: Diabetes (537 million people, 1 in 10 people), causing 6.7 million deaths in 2021.</li>
        <li>One health: Health of people, animals, and the ecosystem are interdependent.</li>
        <li>Healthcare cost: Increase due to aging population, providers increasing cost, and insurance increasing cost.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Continuum</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pre-clinical disease</b>: Disease is not clinically evident. Patients feel minor symptoms and signs,
            thus, they go for screening tests.</li>
        <li><b>Clinical disease</b>: Diagnosed based on clinical findings; symptoms and signs are evident and can be
            observed or measured. Symptoms get serious.</li>
        <li><b>Complications</b>: Worsen symptoms, signs, and clinical tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prevention and Screening</h2>

    <h3>Public Health Coverage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Primary prevention</b>: Prevent onset of disease, keeping the population healthy via health protection
            and health promotion.</li>
        <li><b>Secondary prevention (Screening)</b>: Early diagnosis and effective interventions to delay onset of
            clinical disease.</li>
        <li><b>Tertiary prevention</b>: Effective treatment to delay the onset of complications and death.
            Rehabilitation to improve quality of life. (Note: Tertiary is not covered by public health per the text, but
            included for completeness.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Screening Effectiveness</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Who should be screened</b>: When Positive Predictive Value (PPV) starts to increase significantly (e.g.,
            age 50 for colorectal cancer).</li>
        <li><b>Does screening make a difference?</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Extends lifespan</b>: Early detection of illness leads to early intervention, pushing back the
                    clinical disease and complication phases.</li>
                <li><b>No difference</b>: No serious disease found, or the disease found is slow-moving (e.g., prostate
                    cancer), thus, it will not be life-threatening during lifetime.</li>
                <li><b>Shortens lifespan</b>: With prostate cancer, unnecessary treatments (like surgery and radiation)
                    can induce serious side effects (e.g., incontinence and sexual dysfunction).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Public health does NOT cover:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tertiary prevention: Effective treatment to delay the onset of complications and death. Rehabilitation to
            improve quality of life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Screening Test Result</h3>
    <p>Disease Yes No Predictive Value PPV: a/(a+b) NPV: d/(c+d) Sensitivity: a/(a+c) Specificity: d/(b+d)</p>
    <p>Where a=TP, b=FP, c=FN, d=TN.</p>

    <h2>Examples of public health in action specifically in Singapore:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce tobacco use through taxation and public smoking bans.</li>
        <li>Protect People from communicable diseases via vaccination programs and public awareness campaigns.</li>
        <li>Provide healthier food options in schools and workplaces to combat obesity.</li>
        <li>Ensure access to safe drinking water and sanitation to prevent waterborne diseases.</li>
        <li>Provide women with cancer screenings (e.g., breast, cervical) for early detection and treatment.</li>
        <li>Encourage healthy lifestyles through public campaigns promoting exercise and balanced diets to reduce NCDs.
        </li>
        <li>Promote on-the-job safety regulations to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses.</li>
        <li>Advocate mental health awareness and provide support services to reduce stigma and improve access to care.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>What is public health? add-on: Public health is the "science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and
        promoting health through organized efforts of society, organisations, public and private communities, and
        individuals."</p>

    <p>Public health's approach:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Surveillance: Monitor health data to identify trends and outbreaks.</li>
        <li>Risk Factor Identification: Determine causes and risk factors for diseases.</li>
        <li>Intervention Evaluation: Assess effectiveness of public health interventions.</li>
        <li>Implementation: Scale up successful interventions to broader populations.</li>
        <li>Continuous Monitoring: Ongoing assessment to adapt strategies as needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>1. Surveillance: What is the problem? - 5Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why) + How</p>

    <p>2. Risk Factor Identification: What is the cause? - Identify risk factors (Epi, Bio, Socio) - preventable or not
        - controllable or not - priority</p>

    <p>3. Intervention Evaluation: How to mitigate or prevent the problem? - Identify possible interventions - requires:
        strategy, funding, political will, a champion > champion: someone influential to push the agenda</p>

    <p>4. Implementation</p>

    <p>5. Continuous Monitoring > Did it work? > After implementation, continue surveillance to monitor effectiveness
        and adapt strategies as needed. > Can you expand or replicate it?</p>

    <p>Case study: Leading cause of death in Arizona children 0-4 years old from 1986-1996?</p>

    <p>- Monitoring: 5Ws 1H - Drowning in pools, mostly in summer, ages 1-4, all over Arizona, due to lack of
        supervision and pool fencing.</p>
    <p>- Risk factors: lack of pool fencing, lack of adult supervision, lack of swimming skills. Cause: Epidemiological
        (high incidence in young children), Biological (children's inability to swim), Socioeconomic (lack of pool
        fencing in low-income areas).</p>
    <p>- Intervention: Legislation for pool fencing, public education on supervision and swimming lessons.</p>
    <p>PH approach: 1. Seek legislative action 2. develop community awareness 3. develop an individual pool safety
        program - encompassing policy, social, and individual levels. - Outcome: Significant reduction in drowning
        incidents after implementation.</p>

    <p># what is health? State of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or
        infirmity.</p>

    <p>Internal + external environment - Internal: Genetic, Physiological, Pathological - External: Physical, Social,
        Economic, Cultural</p>

    <p>These contribute to health</p>

    <h2>Social determinants of health</h2>
    <p>Circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work, and age, as well as the systems put in place to deal
        with illness.</p>

    <p>shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, politics.</p>

    <p>examples: -income -education -occupation -access to healthcare -housing -unemployment -transportation -ethnicity
        -gender -sexual orientation -food insecurity</p>

    <p>have a significant impact on : -predisposition of individuals and groups to illness -the way they experience and
        recover from illness</p>

    <p><b>Factors</b>: Income, housing, education, SES, job security, working condition, transport, access to services,
        physical environment, race, gender, stress, food insecurity.</p>

    <p><b>Impacts</b>: Predisposition to illness, and recovery from illness.</p>

    <h2>Socio-ecological model of health</h2>
    <p>Health is affected by the interaction between the characteristics of the individual, the community, and the
        environment that includes social, physical and political components.</p>

    <p><b>Levels (IIICP)</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>I (Individual)</b>: Age, sex, genes, ethnicity, SES, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs.</li>
        <li><b>I (Interpersonal)</b>: Family, peers, friends.</li>
        <li><b>I (Institutional)</b>: Home, school. Access to facilities, goods and services within the institution,
            living/working conditions, structural factors, institutional regulations/policies.</li>
        <li><b>C (Community)</b>: Neighborhood. Access to facilities, goods and services within a larger social
            environment, healthcare, community education, safety, sanitation, spaces, sociocultural norms,
            economic/political influence.</li>
        <li><b>P (Policies &amp; Law)</b>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Purpose of SEM</b>: Understand environmental influence on behavior and modify influences for public health
        interventions.</p>

    <p><b>Note</b>: Intrapersonal is part of the individual level. Example: A research study found that the lack of knowledge, and misperceptions about influenza vaccines were the main reasons why vaccination rates are suboptimal among the elderly. This is situated under <b>intrapersonal</b>.</p>

    <p>Institutional/Organizational: Access to facilities, goods and services within the institution Living/working
        conditions structural factors (e.g., policies, rules, regulations) Institutional regulations and policies</p>

    <p>Community: access to facilities, goods and services within the community within a larger social network
        Health/social services community education safety sanitation spaces sociocultural norms, values, traditions
        economic, political influences</p>

    <p>Policies: local, state, national, global laws and policies that regulate or support healthy actions and practices
        for disease prevention, early detection, control, and management.</p>

    <p>Defining a health system: WHO(2010): A health system consists of all organisations, people and actions whose
        primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health.</p>

    <p><b>Note</b>: This includes informal caregivers, e.g., a wife taking care of a sick husband.</p>

    <p>Boundaries: A heatlh system includes teh resources, actors and institutions related to the financing, regulation
        and provision of health actions.</p>

    <p><b>Goals of HS (World Health Report 2000)</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Better health is unquestionably the primary goal of a health system.</li>
        <li>A second goal of health systems is therefore fairness in financial contribution toward the costs of ill-health. Because health care can be catastrophically costly and the need for it unpredictable, mechanisms for sharing risk and providing financial protection are important.</li>
        <li>A third goal – responsiveness to people’s expectations in regard to non-health matters – reflects the importance of respecting people’s dignity, autonomy and the confidentiality of information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Note on Responsiveness</b>: Responsiveness refers to non-health aspects like dignity, confidentiality, autonomy, prompt attention, quality of amenities, access to social support, choice of provider. It does NOT include availability of medications for rare genetic diseases, as that's service provision.</p>
    <p>Restricted, Non-Sensitive World Health Organization. (2000). The world health report 2000: health systems: improving performance. World Health Organization. https://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf?ua=1</p>

    <p><b>health system vs healthcare system</b> - health system: all organisations, people and actions whose primary
        intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. - healthcare system: part of the health system that includes
        organisations, people and actions whose primary intent is to improve health.</p>

    <h2>Healthcare system</h2>
    <p><b>Primary care</b>: Intended usual first point of contact for individuals with the health system. Provide referrals to secondary or tertiary care as needed. Coverage: <b>5,000−50,000 (locality)</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Secondary care</b>: Secondary care involves more specialised clinical expertise such as hospital care. Physicians are located at hospital-based clinics and serve as consultants for outpatient referrals from GPs(General Practitioners). Also provide care to hospitalised inpatients. e.g. acute care in emergency departments, planned elective care, usually hospital-based. Coverage: <b>50,000−500,000 (district)</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Tertiary care</b>: Involves the management of rare disorders. Such as cardiac surgery, cancer management, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, treatment of severe burns, advanced neonatology services. Coverage: <b>500,000−5,000,000</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Long term care</b>: Help with everyday activities, such as dressing, bathing, eating. Provided at home, in the community, in assisted living facilities, or in nursing homes.</p>

    <p><b>Institutions of health in Singapore</b>: <b>MOH</b> > <b>HSA</b>, <b>HPB</b>, <b>AIC</b>, <b>SYNAPSE</b> > <b>NHG</b>, <b>NUHS</b>, <b>SINGHEALTH</b></p>

    <p><b>MOH</b>: Ministry of Health Oversees national health policies and healthcare system. <b>HSA</b>: Health Sciences Authority Regulates health products, including pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Administration of justice with use of forensic science, securing blood supply for public and private hospitals, regulating health products to meet safety, quality, and efficacy. <b>SYNAPSE</b>: National eHealth Collaborative Develops and implements health IT systems. Connects people and systems to power a healthier Singapore and improve health (e.g., Health Hub for patient use, electronic medical record system for clinical use (NGEMR), consolidated health records system at national-level (NEHR)). <b>HPB</b>: Health Promotion Board Promotes healthy living through public health campaigns and programs. Promote healthy living via programs (e.g., student health center, school dental center, Healthier Choice, National Steps, school programmes, workplace programs). <b>AIC</b>: Agency for Integrated Care Coordinates care for the elderly and those with chronic conditions. <b>NHG</b>: National Healthcare Group Manages public healthcare institutions in the northern region. <b>NUHS</b>: National University Health System Integrates education, research, and clinical care. <b>SINGHEALTH</b>: Singapore Health Services Largest healthcare group, managing multiple hospitals and specialty centers.</p>

        home palliative/nursing care, meal delivery, medical transport.</p>

    <h2>Health Interventions</h2>
    <p><b>Target, action, means</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Target: individual, community, society</li>
        <li>Action: education, policy, environment</li>
        <li>Means: information, motivation, obligation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Micro, meso, macro levels</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Micro: individual, family</li>
        <li>Meso: community, organization</li>
        <li>Macro: society, government</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Concerns in the 21st century</b>: Aging population, frailty, chronic diseases, and poor lifestyle habits.</p>

    <p><b>Most effective point to intervene</b>: Children, as biological capital sets the level of health at conception.
        For effective interventions, a multi-sectoral approach is required to create environments so healthy choices are
        easier.</p>

    <p><b>Current HI in Singapore</b></p>
    <p><b>Micro</b>: <b>National Steps Challenge</b>: Incentivize walking, running, and other moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. <b>Age-appropriate Health Screening in schools</b>: E.g., vision and hearing screening, growth and development assessment. <b>National Childhood Immunisation Schedule in schools</b>: Immunization against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis. (Measles and diphtheria are mandatory by the Infectious Diseases Act, making them Macro). <b>Project Silver Screen</b>: Screening for vision, hearing, and oral health for Singaporeans age 60 and above. <b>Screen for Life</b>: Heavily subsidized screening for chronic diseases. <b>Colorectal cancer screening</b>: Singapore Cancer Society distributes FIT kits FOC to eligible Singaporeans. Yearly screening for age ≥50. <b>Cancers in women</b>: Bringing mammograms to people's doorsteps. <b>Chronic disease screen</b> (HBP, cholesterol, diabetes, obesity): Tri-yearly screening for age ≥40. <b>Cervical cancer screen</b>: Tri-yearly screening for age ≥25. <b>HealthierSG</b>: Enrollment, free first visit to discuss health and develop health plans, follow the plan on the app, check in with the doctor. <b>Advance Care Planning</b>: Plan and decide future healthcare treatments. <b>Caregiver training</b>: E.g., personal care techniques, recognizing early warning signs.</p>

Pooling resources, peer learning, and benchmarking clinical outcomes. <b>Hospital to Home</b>: Patients stratified to care needs, home visits, tele-monitoring, feedback from the care team. <b>Multiple Readmissions Predictive Model</b>: Lower chances of readmission by providing precision care for each patient. <b>AIC Link</b>: Help to find care-at-home, center-based care, and caregiver support.</p>

    <p><b>Macro</b>: <b>Nutri-Grade for beverages, Healthier Options</b>. <b>CHAS (Community Health Assist Scheme)</b>: Citizens receive subsidies for medical and dental care at GPs, dentists, and public specialist outpatient clinics. <b>Hospital Subsidies</b>: Up to 80% off at public institutions. <b>ElderShield and CareShield Life</b>: Premium payout starts at 40 and 30 respectively and ends at 65 and 67 respectively.</p>

    <p><b>Health Impact Pyramid</b></p>
    <p><b>Increasing population impact</b> (from bottom to top): Counselling and education, clinical interventions, long-lasting protective interventions, changing the context to make individuals' default decisions healthy, socioeconomic factors.</p>
    <p><b>Increasing individual effort</b> (from top to bottom): Socioeconomic factors, changing the context to make individuals' default decisions healthy, long-lasting protective interventions, clinical interventions, counselling and education.</p>

    <h2>Nutrition</h2>

    <h3>Malnutrition</h3>
    <p><b>Triple Burden of Malnutrition</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Under-nutrition: Being underweight, stunted, wasted, micronutrient deficiencies.</li>
        <li>Micronutrient deficiencies: Iron, vitamin A, iodine.</li>
        <li>Overweight and obesity: Excess body fat that may impair health.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Note</b>: Macronutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, fats (needed in large amounts). Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals (needed in small amounts). Lacking iodine and zinc results in micronutrient deficiency, not macronutrient.</p>

    <p><b>BMI Risk Levels (Asian)</b>: Low risk (18.5−22.9), Moderate risk (23−27.4), High risk (27.5 and above). Higher
        BMI is linked to a greater risk of diabetes and lower insulin sensitivity. Race affects insulin sensitivity too.
    </p>

    <h3>Poor Diet</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Excess calories.</li>
        <li>Saturated fats (fast food, red meat).</li>
        <li>Poor quality carbohydrates (refined carbohydrates, sweet drinks).</li>
        <li>Lack of fiber, vitamins, and minerals (lack of fruits, vegetables, whole grains).</li>
        <li>Sweet drinks: Hidden source of calories, liquid calories are not filling (people do not reduce food intake),
            and addictive.</li>
        <li>Inappropriate vegetarian diets: Can lead to deficiencies in protein, omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, vitamin
            D, vitamin B12, iron, and zinc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Healthy Eating Guidelines</h3>
    <p><b>Healthy Plate</b>: Half plate fruits and vegetables, 1/4 wholemeal carbs, 1/4 meat and others.</p>

    <p><b>Healthy Options (Daily Servings)</b>: 5−7 servings rice and alternatives, 2 servings fruits and vegetables, 3
        servings meat and alternatives, small amounts of fats, oil, sugar, and salt.</p>

    <p><b>Carbohydrates</b>: Minimum processed whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and beans maintain blood sugar at a
        steady state (lower GI) and promote good health. Whole grains provide fiber, B vitamins, minerals, and
        phytochemicals. Must have carbs for healthy energy intake.</p>

    <p><b>Protein</b>: 3 servings a day, 1 serving from dairy or calcium-rich products. Cooking method matters; no
        processed meat.</p>

    <p>Too much protein: 1) Nutritional deficiencies (fiber), 2) bad breath, headache, constipation, 3) worsen kidney
        issues for those with kidney disease, 4) heart disease, type 2 diabetes, etc..</p>

    <p><b>Fruits and Vegetables</b>: Lesser people are eating fruits and vegetables. They assist in food to energy
        conversion, act as coenzymes and cofactors to catalyze specific reactions, and are needed for catabolic and
        anabolic pathways.</p>

    <h3>Obesity Cycle (Childhood to Adulthood)</h3>
    <p>Healthy child (no exercise/eat unhealthily) → mildly obese child (low self-esteem) → moderately obese child (subjected to bullying) → severely obese child (health and mental issues) → obese adult (chronic disease and poor mental health).</p>

    <h3>Modifiable Risk Factors for NCDs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Unhealthy diet.</li>
        <li>Physical inactivity.</li>
        <li>Tobacco use.</li>
        <li>Harmful use of alcohol.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Aspects of Diet Should be Targeted for NCD Prevention?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Excess calories.</li>
        <li>Saturated fats.</li>
        <li>Poor quality carbohydrates (sugars, refined grains).</li>
        <li>Lack of fibre, vitamins, minerals.</li>
        <li>High sodium, preserved foods.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Minimally Processed Whole Grains, Fruits, Vegetables, Nuts, Legumes, Fish, Lean Meats</b>: Provide energy to support body functions, rich in vitamins, minerals, fibre, antioxidants.</p>

    <p><b>Rule of Thumb</b>: Avoid processed foods, eat more whole foods, eat in moderation by controlling portion size, protein rich foods, healthy fats, complex carbs, limit sugar, salt, alcohol.</p>

    <p><b>Children and Healthy Eating</b>: Children show a tendency to taste unfamiliar foods more readily when they observe adults eating them. They model themselves on their parent's behaviour, lifestyle and body dissatisfaction. <b>Peer Modelling</b>: Children are more likely to try new foods if they see their peers eating them and enjoying them.</p>

    <h3>Place and Setting for Healthy Eating</h3>
    <p>Home, school, workplace, community settings. Accessible and affordable healthy food options. Advertising and marketing regulations. For effective interventions: Go beyond health sector, 'whole-of-government' and 'whole-of-society' approach. Multi-sectoral collaboration is required to create enabling environments for healthy eating and active living.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <p>Among modifiable causes of disease, diet-related factors are a major contributor to global ill-health. Different dietary components work in synergy to prevent NCDs. Knowledge alone is insufficient to change behaviour, environmental and policy interventions may be among the most effective strategies to promote healthy eating population-wide.</p>

    <h2>Infectious Diseases</h2>
    <p>case: cholera still a problem globally, in 2019 about 1 million cases, 1.9k deaths were notified from 31
        countries.</p>

    <p><b>Types of Infections</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Emerging: Catastrophic.</li>
        <li>Re-emerging: Known about it, but not spending enough time and resources on it.</li>
        <li>Disease X: Characterized by: 1) Fatality (potential to cause harm), 2) Infectivity (potential to spread), 3)
            Knowledge (lack of updated scientific and public health understanding to deal with the infection).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Emerging vs Re-emerging</b>: Emerging infectious diseases are new infections that have not been previously identified in humans. Re-emerging are those that have been fully eradicated previously but re-appeared. Do not consider time period; if it has never been eradicated, it's emerging. Example: Nipah virus originates from Sungai Nipah, a village in Malaysian Peninsula in year 1999. Since then, there have been outbreaks almost every year in South Asia, resulting in severe disease and death. Nipah is a <b>newly emerging infectious disease</b>, same category as Covid-19.</p>

    <p><b>Infectious Disease Epidemiology</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify cause.</li>
        <li>Surveillance.</li>
        <li>Identify source.</li>
        <li>Studies of route of transmission.</li>
        <li>Identify risk factors and interventions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Surveillance</b> Continuous, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data needed
        for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.</p>

    <p><b>Passive surveillance</b>: Ongoing reporting of a set of known diseases by health facilities in a designated
        region; lower cost. Risk of overlooking unknown or excluded pathogens or conditions.</p>

    <p><b>Active surveillance</b>: Targeted tests, medical records review, healthcare providers interviewed to identify
        disease. Provides timely, accurate, and complete data. Requires prior knowledge of detection methods or known
        symptoms; resource intensive.</p>

    <p><b>Types of Surveillance</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sentinel: Pre-defined list of healthcare providers to provide samples or clinical data over a period of
            time. Low-level outbreaks: Focus on high-risk groups (e.g., STD testing of sex workers). High-prevalence
            outbreaks: Focus on both high-risk groups and population settings (e.g., primary care clinics). Hard to
            estimate the true size of an outbreak since it's only from pre-selected clinics.</li>
        <li>Seroprevalence: Antibody test to estimate the percentage of people in the population who have been infected.
        </li>
        <li>Syndromic: Monitor and detect potential outbreaks based on symptom patterns; early detection of outbreaks.
        </li>
        <li>Genomic: Track the emergence of new variants; costly.</li>
        <li>Social media.</li>
        <li>National Notifiable Disease surveillance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Examples</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Genomic Surveillance</b>: Through genotyping in patients with dengue, it helps to identify potential emergence of new dengue strains. Genomic surveillance involves the use of genetic sequencing (like genotyping) to monitor pathogens.</li>
        <li><b>Sentinel Surveillance</b>: By mandating doctors in public institutions to provide nasal swabs of elderly patients for tuberculosis test, this data collection is an example of sentinel surveillance. Sentinel surveillance involves collecting data from a pre-selected network of sites on specific health events or diseases.</li>
        <li><b>False Example</b>: Monitoring the frequency of flu cases in a population to identify potential influenza outbreak is <b>NOT</b> an example of national notifiable disease surveillance. National notifiable disease surveillance specifically refers to the mandatory, legal requirement for healthcare providers to report confirmed cases of specific diseases to public health authorities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Genomic Surveillance Gains</b>: 1) Identification of source and type, 2) improve treatment efficacy by
        identifying drug-resistant pathogens, 3) minimize further progression to multi-drug resistance, 4) tracking of
        disease transmission.</p>

    <p><b>Social Media Surveillance Risks</b>: 1) High risk of sampling bias by age, language, geography, SES, gender,
        2) digital search confounding.</p>

    <p><b>Bias in surveillance</b>: Lower-income countries do not have resources to do proper surveillance, thus, lower
        cases are reported.</p>

    <p><b>Disease X</b>: Hypothetical, unknown pathogen causing a serious international epidemic. Could be viral,
        bacterial, fungal, parasitic, prion. Could be known or unknown. Could be zoonotic or human-only. Could be
        vector-borne, foodborne, waterborne, airborne, direct contact. Keyword: uncertain, serious.</p>

    <h2>#Preventing Obesity, Diabetes, and Cardiovascular Disease through nutrition</h2>
    <p>contributions of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases to global health and health in Singapore</p>

    <p>Obesity: Global Phenomenon co-morbidities in obese children: low esteem, stigmatization & poor socialisation,
        health issues, behavioural & emotional difficulties, reduced educational attainment, strong predictor of adult
        obesity & risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease.</p>

    <p><b>BMI not a good indicator of health</b>: Asians have a much lower BMI compared to Whites for the same fat
        percentage. Asian fat forms around organs, while White fat forms below the skin, forming a belly.</p>

    <p><b>Obesity trend</b>: Males and females in the 20−40 age group have a significant prevalence in obesity rate.</p>

    <p><b>Obesity leads to higher rates of diabetics.</b></p>

    <p><b>Complications of diabetes</b>: Damage to small and large vessels as sugar attacks inner linings, causing blood
        clots, vessel damage, and nerve damage. Can also cause stroke and heart attack.</p>

    <p><b>Causes of obesity</b>: Epigenetics, genes, energy intake more than output, microbiome, and obesity are all
        connected.</p>

    <p><b>Ecological model for obesity</b>: Equilibrium fat stores = (energy intake − energy output) + physiological
        adjustments. Biology and environment affect behavior, which in turn affects this equation.</p>

    <p><b>Social influences on obesity</b>: Role models (children observe and model adults' behavior, lifestyle, and
        body dissatisfaction), and peer modeling.</p>

    <p><b>Physical environment on health</b>: Accessibility and affordability of healthy food and for physical
        activities.</p>

    <p><b>Obesity cycle (Childhood to Adulthood)</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Healthy child (no exercise/eat unhealthily) → mildly obese child (low self-esteem) → moderately obese child
            (subjected to bullying) → severely obese child (health and mental issues) → obese adult (chronic disease and
            poor mental health).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Triple Burden of malnutrition: Under-nutrition - being underweight, stunted, wasted, micronutrient deficiencies
        Micronutrient deficiencies - iron, vitamin A, iodine Overweight and obesity - excess body fat that may impair
        health</p>

    <p>Modifiable risk factors for NCDs: - Unhealthy diet - Physical inactivity - Tobacco use - Harmful use of alcohol
    </p>

    <p>What aspects of diet should be targeted for NCD prevention? - excess calories - saturated fats - poor quality
        carbohydrates (sugars, refined grains) - lack of fibre, vitamins, minerals - high sodium, preserved foods</p>

    <p>Minimally processed whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, lean meats provide energy to support
        body functions, rich in vitamins, minerals, fibre, antioxidants.</p>

    <p>rule of thumb: avoid processed foods, eat more whole foods, eat in moderation by controlling portion size,
        protein rich foods, healthy fats, complex carbs, limit sugar, salt, alcohol.</p>

    <p>children show a tendency to tate unfamiliar foods more readily when they ovserve adults eating them. They model

        healthy eating population-wide.</p>

    <h2>Public Health Genomics</h2>
    <p>Public health genomics: Contains 'instructions' to create an organism, encoded in chemicals known as "DNA".</p>

    <p><b>Genomics Sizes (base pairs)</b>: Virus (170,000), bacteria (4.6 million), flies (130 million), humans (3.2
        billion), canopy plant (150 billion).</p>

    <p><b>Genomic Epidemiology</b>: Use genomic data to determine the distribution and determinants of health-related
        outcomes in a specified population and the application of this information to control health problems.</p>

    <p>Genes, DNA, and chromosomes: Genes determine what traits are passed down from mother to father.</p>

    <p><b>Precision Medicine Goals</b>: 1) Pre-empt health conditions from happening and act before it's too late, 2)
        faster diagnosis, 3) optimized treatment, 4) novel treatment (understand conditions to inform development of
        novel drugs).</p>

    <p><b>Pharmacogenomics</b>: Use of genetic and genomic information to tailor pharmaceutical treatment. Example:
        HLA-B*1502 gene will cause life-threatening side effects of carbamazepine treatment for epilepsy.</p>

    <p><b>Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) of genomics</b>: What conditions should be screened for in
        newborn babies? Public good vs. personal privacy.</p>

    <p><b>Genetic Tests</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diagnostics genetic tests: Test to confirm a diagnosis based on existing symptoms and signs.</li>
        <li>Predictive genetic tests: Predict a future risk of disease without symptoms or signs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vegetarian Diets</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lactovegetarian (Lactoveg): Excludes meat, fish, poultry, eggs, but allows dairy products.</li>
        <li>Ovovegetarian (Ovoveg): Excludes meat, fish, poultry, seafood, dairy, but allows eggs.</li>
        <li>Lacto-Ovo-Vegetarian (Lacto-ovoveg): Excludes meat, fish, poultry, but allows dairy and eggs.</li>
