## The 10 Intellectual Standards:

1. Clarity
1. Accuracy
1. Relevance
1. Logicalness
1. Breadth
1. Precision
1. Significance
1. Completeness
1. Fairness
1. Depth

### Clarity (Intellectual Standard)
Clarity is the quality of being easily understood, free from confusion or ambiguity. In critical thinking, clarity is essential because if a statement or idea is unclear, it is impossible to assess its accuracy, relevance, or significance. Clarity is the foundation for all other intellectual standards.

**How to achieve clarity:**
- Restate the idea in simpler terms
- Ask for examples or illustrations
- Request further explanation or elaboration

**Questions to promote clarity:**
- Can you elaborate on that point?
- Could you give an example?
- Can you rephrase that in another way?

**Why clarity matters:**
Without clarity, communication breaks down and reasoning cannot proceed. Clear thinking ensures that everyone understands the issue or argument in the same way, which is necessary for meaningful discussion and problem-solving.

**Clarity as the Gateway Standard:**
Clarity is considered the gateway to all other intellectual standards because it creates understandability. If a statement is not clear, you cannot determine if it is accurate, relevant, or logical. Only when an idea is clearly understood can you effectively apply the other standards—such as accuracy, precision, and relevance—to evaluate or build upon it. In this way, clarity enables meaningful analysis, discussion, and problem-solving.

### Accuracy
Accuracy means being free from errors, mistakes, or distortions. In critical thinking, accuracy ensures that information is true and correct. Without accuracy, conclusions and decisions may be based on false premises.

**Questions to ask:**
- Is that really true?
- How can we check that?
- How can we verify or test that?

### Relevance
Relevance means focusing on information and arguments that relate directly to the issue at hand. Relevant information helps address the question or problem; irrelevant information distracts from it.

**Questions to ask:**
- How does that relate to the problem?
- How does this help us with the issue?

### Logicalness (Logic)
Logicalness means reasoning in a way that makes sense and follows from the evidence. Logic ensures that conclusions follow from premises and that arguments are coherent.

**Questions to ask:**
- Does this make sense?
- Does that follow from what you said?
- How does that conclusion follow?

### Breadth
Breadth means considering a range of perspectives or viewpoints. It involves looking at the issue from different angles and avoiding narrow thinking.

**Questions to ask:**
- Do we need to look at this from another perspective?
- What would this look like from a different viewpoint?

### Precision
Precision means providing enough detail to be specific and exact. In critical thinking, precision avoids vagueness and generalities.

**Questions to ask:**
- Can you be more specific?
- Can you give more details?
- Can you be exact?

### Significance
Significance means focusing on the most important information, ideas, or issues. It helps prioritize what matters most in reasoning and decision-making.

**Questions to ask:**
- Which of these facts are most important?
- What is the central idea?
- Why is this important?

### Completeness
Completeness means addressing all necessary parts of a question or problem. It ensures that reasoning is thorough and nothing essential is left out.

**Questions to ask:**
- Have we considered everything we need to?
- Is there anything missing?

### Fairness
Fairness means being just, impartial, and free from bias. In critical thinking, fairness requires considering all relevant viewpoints and treating them equally.

**Questions to ask:**
- Am I considering all relevant viewpoints?
- Is my thinking influenced by my interests or feelings?
- Am I being fair to others?
